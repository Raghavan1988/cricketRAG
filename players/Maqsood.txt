Spin for the first time in the innings. Here's Maxwell AnotherPK: "Not sure we need to change the dead ball rule. How are fielders supposed to prevent a leg bye if they're required to appeal to get a decision? What umpire is going to seriously consider an appeal when the fielders just mumble "howzat" because they're trying to chase the ball?" Surely, the bowler can appeal - or another fielder if the bowler is busy fetching the ball. This cannot be a reason for stripping teams off runs. Or just have the appeal done after the ball is called dead anyway.

Length ball around off, he defends
