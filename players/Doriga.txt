<strong>trapped in front, and the finger goes up!</strong> Beautifully-disguised googly that pitches on a length on middle stump. Doriga plays for the ball coming in but when it decks away, he is squared up completely. Plays down the wrong line and gets pinned on the back leg. Doriga does not even bother with the review, and that sums up how plumb it was. A useful knock, though, and PNG, courtesy of it, are within reach of a 100-plus score!

This partnership is ticking along nicely for PNG. Can they somehow get up to 110-120? Afghanistan will not be happy with how the last twenty minutes or so have gone. Rashid to bowl out

fullish on middle and leg. Doriga gets down on one knee and drags it towards deep square leg
