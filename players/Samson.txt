<strong>chops it on! Samson falls!</strong> Length delivery angled across the batter just outside off. Samson has a flat-footed poke at it and does not show any real conviction. Might have been trying to steer it to third man but all he managed was an inside edge that rattled into the stumps. India in a spot of bother now!
And that will be <b>drinks</b>. South Africa have come back strongly after the 68-run partnership between Rahul and Sudharsan. Axar is slotted in at 7, with one of Arshdeep or Kuldeep expected to bat at 8. If SA can get another quickly, they will really fancy their chances of bowling India out.
