<strong>Outside edge found and the keeper takes it</strong>. Looked like the scrambled seam. Over the wicket, left-armer's angle taking it away. It pitched around off on a three-quarter length and went through the channel. Fernando tried to block it with a straight bat but could only feather it to Madande. Fernando stood in front of middle and tried to block it while standing leg side of the ball which meant he couldn't cover the line. Pace: 130ks

A round of applause goes across from the crowd. The fielders are out on an overcast afternoon and the batters follow. Avishka Fernando will open with the captain, Kusal Mendis. Richard Ngarava has the new ball. <strong>2:23pm</strong> Time for the national anthems.

It's a fresh pitch with a lot of time to prepare. Dry grass has been rolled on, so carry will be good, ball will come on nicely.

Ngarava to Avishka. A slip in place. <strong>6.20pm</strong> Welcome for the chase. Although it is otherwise a good batting track, the conditions are gloomy, and the ball is turning. Sri Lanka need 209 to go 1-0 up in the series - remember, the first ODI was washed out - as Zimbabwe lost 6 for 26 in a middle- and lower-order collapse despite Ervine's 82. Zimbabwe need early wickets if they hope of taking the lead in the series.

Waddup folks. Welcome if you're just joining. Sri Lanka will want another big score, knowing they will likely have to contend with dew in the defence. Avishka Fernando to face SHoriful Islam. On that note, here's Fidel to take you through the first innings action. Samiddhi: "Interesting decision to go with Pathirana. Thought giving Thushara a chance would be better!" --- If I had to venture a guess, with such few games before the World Cup, the team simply want to give Pathirana as many opportunities as well to perfect his work at the death. Rony: "@Madushka, More questions. What if something happens to your TV? The live commentary will be stopped here?" --- Always have a stream running alongside. Also have a UPS connected to TV/wifi to make sure any power outages are mitigated. <B>Pitch report</b>: "Brand new pitch," says Farveez Mahroof. "Lots of grass, hard underneath. More even grass covering, so good pace and bounce. Tough work for the spinners. Both teams will keep an eye on bringing a fast bowler in and dropping a spinner considering the dew. 190-200 is a must for the team batting first." Nalin: "Why Sri Lanka not going with spinners " --- I'm guessing the dew played quite a major role in their thinking. Also the early swing would definitely help Madushanka. Ayman: "Shakib and Saifuddin in place of Mustafizur and Soumya would make this the perfect team." Mustafa Moudi: "Nobody could have believed that Bangladesh would go this close when they were 30/3 at one point in the wonderful nail-biting last match 2 days ago. The match was so evenly posed that the Extras conceded by both the sides were equal too - 19. Hoping for another thrilling contest from the 2 sides !!" Palinda: "Seems Sri Lanka trust their batting unit after the good outing last time since they sneak in a spspecialist bowler." --- Not sure how much batting Akila was going to be doing anyway, Palinda. Beastmaster: "I am glad Sri Lanka is battling against the dew. You wanna sweat out the wins before the Big Thang!" Lalindra Siriwa: "I think Sri Lanka has now lost 5 tosses in a row. " --- Really stacking the law of averages heading into the World Cup. Jeremy: "Hi Madushka,- Are you typing on a laptop or a desktop?- Are you in Bangladesh or elsewhere?- Do you type sitting on a chair or standing up?Sorry! had to join in the silly question season!!" --- Laptop. Colombo. Beanbag. No silly questions here, Jeremy. <B>Sri Lanka</b>: 1 Avishka Fernando, 2 Kusal Mendis (wk), 3 Kamindu Mendis, 4 Sadeera Samarawickrama, 5 Charith Asalanka (capt.), 6 Angelo Mathews, 7 Dasun Shanaka, 8 Maheesh Theekshana, 9 Dilshan Madushanka, 10 Binura Fernando, 11 Matheesha Pathirana <B>Bangladesh</b>: 1 Litton Das (wk), 2 Najmul Hossain Shanto (capt), 3 Soumya Sarkar, 4 Towhid Hridoy, 5 Mahmudullah, 6 Mahedi Hasan, 7 Jaker Ali, 8 Taskin Ahmed, 9 Rishad Hossain, 10 Mustafizur Rahman, 11 Shoriful Islam In <B>team news</b>, one change for Sri Lanka. Dilshan Madushanka comes in for Akila Dananjaya. Bangladesh unchanged. Beastmaster: "Is it legal to carry battery powered hair dryers to dry the ball? Thinking outta the box...to counter the dew " --- Well they used mints to shine the ball not too long ago, and they use towels now to dry it. So long as the hair dryer doesn't alter the ball's shape or performance, it'd be interesting to see the ICC counter arguments. ErangaGune: "Heard the damage from the dew factor to be expected lesser for today's game." --- Ah, perhaps some good news for Sri Lanka then. Toss is in and Bangladesh have won it once more, <B>they will bowl first again!</b> Lihindu: "Are we expecting dew today as well?" --- Very much so. Tharindu: "Madushka, when will Hasaranga be back, and do you think Dickwella will play today? " --- This is the last match of Hasaranga's ban, so he'll be back next game. As for Dickwella, think it's unlikely we'll see him save for an injury; top three of Avishka, Kusal and Kamindu likely to be in place again today. <B>5.20pm</b> The good news today is that there's expected to be a much bigger crowd in attendance. As per Isam: "There was about 8,000 in attendance last match, with a max stadium capacity of 18,000. But after the way that game went, the excitement has increased quite a bit. There are reports of people coming in from other districts as well and we might even get a full house today." As Isam points out in <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ban-vs-sl-1st-t20i-jaker-ali-keeps-hitting-out-and-learning-under-the-watchful-eye-of-his-journalist-sister-1423584">this lovely piece,</a> it was definitely a painful experience for Jaker, but also bittersweet as he had his sister, a journalist, in attendance, who even asked him a question post-match. For what it's worth my sister asks me questions all the time post-match, but it's generally along the lines of "why isn't the match report up already? I need to sleep!" I suspect Jaker was much happier to hear from his sibling. Just a quick recap of game one then, Sri Lanka won but Bangladesh scared the bejeezus out of them in the process courtesy some grade A belligerence from Mahmadullah and Jaker Ali. Jaker's knock though is the one that will have burned itself into the memories of those in attendance, as he nearly singlehandedly dragged his side over the finish line before falling agonisingly at the final hurdle. <B>5.10pm</b> Hello and welcome to Bangladesh v Sri Lanka (Sylhet edition) part 2. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/bangladesh-vs-sri-lanka-2023-24-1419819/bangladesh-vs-sri-lanka-1st-t20i-1419824/match-report">Part 1 </a>on Monday evening was alright, I guess.

oof, decided to leave it late and it took an under edge but no damage done. This is angled well across Avishka who shapes to pull originally, but decides late to leave it. But as the bat is still hanging out it takes the under edge and bounces through to the keeper

glorious square drive. This is full, just wide of off, and Avishka stands tall to thread it between point and cover to collect his second boundary of the over. Sri Lanka are traveling briskly here.

Avishka Fernando c †Mushfiqur Rahim b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 33 (33b 5x4 1x6 45m) SR: 100
<strong>edged and gone!</strong> This is excellent from Tanzim, who has bowled that very tempting length, pushed it wide of the batter and got him to play away from his body, and seamed it away ever so slighly to miss the middle of the bat and take the edge. It's only a light touch, so Mushfiq has no issues behind the stumps. That's a vital breakthroguh for Bangladesh. Avishka was getting into his work.
