Sundar is OUT! caught
c Markram b Hendricks
Washington Sundar c Markram b Hendricks 14 (9b 2x4 0x6 12m) SR: 155.55
very good catch in the deep! Washington nails this full toss off the middle, Markram takes the catch but quickly pops the ball back up because the momentum is likely to take him over. But he regathers himself to complete the catch.
