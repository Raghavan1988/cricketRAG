googly tossed up full outside off. Nao looks to go downtown but does not seem to pick the variation. Swings at it and misses as the ball turns past the outside edge. Gurbaz takes off the bails and enquires for the stumping, and like it happens in most cases, <strong>we go upstairs to check. A part of his back foot is grounded behind the crease, and Nao stays!</strong>

<strong>holes out to long on!</strong> Hard length on middle and off. Seems to hold in the surface a shade and that meddles with Nao's timing, who is looking to swat this over long on. Clinks it off the toe-end and Rashid runs in, completing the catch well inside the fence!

huge hack across the line, <B>picks out Mitchell at long-on!</B> PNG are all out for 78, a decent recovery in the end. But this won't be a significant challenge, you wouldn't think
<B>1.04pm</B> That innings comprised 81 dot balls, and 23 of those came from Lockie Ferguson, whose only run-conceding ball was leg byes. Nothing of note for PNG to take home, though Vanua launched a pleasing straight six off Ish Sodhi. You'd imagine Devon Conway is primed to reply in kind. Boult: "Feels a bit weird, a few emotions over the last couple of days, gutted to not go further, but proud of what I've done in the Black Cap. I'm not sure [if it's my final game], I haven't forecast further than this, but this is the last game at the World Cup. Enjoyed being out there. Southee, a very good friend of mine, shared a dressing-room for well over 12 years, close off the field, nice to be out with him for the last couple of days. It's about moving forward from here. {Last ball] I chose the yorker. A great stage, I enjoyed the last couple of games. Mixed emotions in the camp, didn't start how we wanted to, we were off the ball, it's a short format, that's all it takes. Tricky wicket, but a total I back our boys to chase."
