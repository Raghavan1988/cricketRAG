<b>12:10pm</b> A stop-start innings for India. Samson and Rohit could not get going early and India's powerplay blushes were spared by Pant, who sparkled with a 32-ball 53. He then retired hurt and Dube had an excellent opportunity to show off his skills. Unfortunately for him and India, he laboured to a 16-ball 14. Pandya got stuck into the bowlers late in the innings, and his 40-run cameo has allowed India to post a total in excess of 180. Bangladesh tried a lot of things and bowlers in this innings and will be largely happy with how it went. Mahedi was impressive, bagging a wicket and only conceding 22 runs in four overs. Shoriful was not bad either, although Bangladesh will now be sweating over the injury he picked up. Shakib was uncharacteristically expensive, although Bangladesh, at this stage, will feel they can chase this down and head to their T20 World Cup opener high on confidence.
