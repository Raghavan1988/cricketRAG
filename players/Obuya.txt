Robinson Obuya c †Rahmanullah Gurbaz b Fazalhaq Farooqi 14 (25b 0x4 1x6 42m) SR: 56
<strong>another nick, and another wicket for Farooqi!</strong> Shortish outside off. Skids off the surface and Obuya, who dangles his bat, gets a healthy edge. Gurbaz claimed the catch, having dived forward but the umpires just want to be sure if this has carried. <strong>No doubt about the edge. And no doubt on the fairness of the catch either. Gloves well under the ball, and Farooqi has his first five-wicket haul in T20I cricket!</strong>
