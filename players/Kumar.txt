great bowling, and great fielding! Iftikhar, the man at long-on, runs and rushes to his left to pull the ball back last moment to keep it to three - or so it seems. Yup, it is confirmed as three.

USA need 5 from 1... A four will mean a tie, and a Super Over

<b>this goes into a Super Over!</b> Lofted over mid-off like a hero, and the game is tied! This will be the second Super Over of the tournament already, as USA keep their hopes of an upset alive. This was lofted beautifully under pressure, with Nitish making room and standing outside leg. Rauf went for a yorker, but it ended up as a low full toss. He chipped it nicely over mid-off, leaving Babar with a sour face
<strong>2.17pm (12.17am PST)</strong> Please wake up and join the action again if you had gone back to bed already! USA could yet beat Pakistan. As per the rules, the hosts will bat first in the Super Over. Terrific game of cat and mouse all along: Pakistan made their way to 159 after being 26 for 3 at one stage, before USA lost their way despite needing only 56 from the remaining 45 balls, with eight wickets in hand. Join Ekanth for the first over of the eliminator.

<strong>Picked and how!</strong> That has gone miles into the stands. On a length on off, he keeps his head down and sends it 95m over wide long-on. Hit with the wind, but that was going for a six on any ground

Kumar is OUT! caught
c Stubbs b Rabada
Nitish Kumar c Stubbs b Rabada 8 (6b 0x4 1x6 9m) SR: 133.33
<strong>Up in the air and that's a second wicket for Rabada!</strong> On a length on the pads, he flicks but doesn't get a clean connection. The ball hits the high part of his bat and Stubbs at deep square leg isn't dropping those. Nitish clipped that into the breeze and that was another reason the ball didn't travel as much as it should have.
