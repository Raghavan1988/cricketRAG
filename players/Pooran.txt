A horrible misjudgement from the fielder at deep midwicket. Rashid goes full again, Pooran heaves it after clearing his front leg. Ibrahim perhaps ran in a touch while moving to his right, stretches his right hand out but makes no contact

Rashid for his last For those of you joining us late, here is a recap of <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-pooran-goes-on-rampage-as-omarzai-concedes-36-in-an-over-1439301">the 36-run Omarzai over</a>

Floated full on leg, Pooran goes for the slog but gets hit on the back leg. Rashid appeals for lbw, but did it pitch outside leg? Rashid takes the most low-key and belated review. It did pitch outside line and spun in ever-so slightly for it to miss leg

<b>A rocket throw Omarzai ends Pooran's blitz!</b> What a throw that, flat and on the full at the striker's end. Pooran belts the slower full ball to deep cover and wants two, but it was the shorter side and Omarzai has rocket arms. Pooran stretches and dives and lies on the ground for a bit, for he knew his fate much before the big screen confirmed it. Walks back to a deserving standing ovation
