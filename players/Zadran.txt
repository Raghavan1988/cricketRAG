This has raised expectations and pressure ahead of the Paris Olympics, but they've <a href="https://www.espn.in/badminton/story/_/id/39270980/path-paris-olympics-2024-satwiksairaj-rankireddy-chirag-shetty-embrace-pressure-master-mind-games" target="_blank">embraced this in their quest for glory</a>. <b>8.33pm</b> After opting to bowl in chilly conditions, India have restricted Afghanistan to 158 for 5. Axar was the best bowler on display, coming away with 2 for 23 in his four overs. That Afghanistan reached a competitive score was down to late blows from Omarzai and Nabi. India also experimented with their attack, bowling Washington at the death and using Dube with a new(ish) ball. How will Rohit fare with the bat on his T20I return?

<strong>Najib bites the dust too!</strong> A little like those London buses. Uganda waited an eternity for their first wicket, and they now have three!. Seems a bit of a drag-down but the key thing is that there is no real room to work with for Najib. He swings at it anyway but because he cannot free his arms, he picks out Nakrani at deep square leg. Replays confirm it was an off-spinner angled into Najib!

Najib out to face the last ball

low full toss speared into leg stump. Najib has a swing at it and squirts it off the inside edge towards fine leg. Just a single to end the innings!
<strong>9:10pm</strong> A strange innings which has finished with Afghanistan getting 159. Intent was not a problem in the powerplay (or the first ten overs) but the execution was from an Afghanistan perspective. Then, just after the drinks break, they clicked into gear, with Gurbaz at the forefront. Gurbaz and Ibrahim registered their second-successive 100-plus opening partnership and that set Afghanistan up nicely. Omarzai, after the fall of Ibrahim's wicket, continued that momentum but once he departed, none of the others could really support Gurbaz, meaning that Afghanistan could not push up closer to 170. As for NZ, their fielding was sluggish, especially at the start. There were several lapses, including dropped catches and missed run-out chances. With the ball, they held their own at different stages, with Boult and Santner being the standouts. Ferguson was not bad either. Henry,  though, was expensive and their decision to hold back an over of Bracewell also cost them a few runs, given Mitchell was asked to fill in right at the end. That said, Afghanistan will feel quietly confident of defending this total, just like NZ will be confident of chasing this down. This game seems to be in the balance, and that means we should have a thrilling second innings in store. Join us in a bit for the chase! <b>Rahmanullah Gurbaz:</b> I think it is a very good total for our bowlers. I am happy with this total. The start, it was not easy, especially against the spinners. Happy with my innings as well. It depends on our fielding and how well we field. Our plan was to play Santner as well and we were happy to just take him for 20-odd runs. (On the pitch) I can say it is not easy. I hope we bowl well and field well.
