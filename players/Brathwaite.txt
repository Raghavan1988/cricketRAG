<b>9.55am</b> Right, folks, we are almost ready to go. Australia seeking early inroads. Mitchell Starc gets ready to rumble. Three slips, gully and a short leg... <b>9.50am</b> Players and officials are in the middle for the pre-match ceremony. Members area at the ground filling up nicely, but still plenty of space elsewhere. Will be interesting to see the crowd during the game. <b>9.40am</b> Mark: "So how many tests have been played total by this WI side?" - Before the toss it was 235 (with 166 between Brathwaite and Roach), so you can add 11 onto that tally now. Australia have hit 700. Neal: "I was impressed by wicket-keeper Joshua Da Silva in the warm up game. He made a 2nd innings ton and mentored some of the younger batters throughout the innings. West Indies will need this kind of leadership as one of the more senior players today. " <b>9.30am</b> <b>Australia</b> win the toss and <b>bowl</b>. Pat Cummins: "Looks like there's a bit of grass on it, so hopefully make use of that. We were pretty sold on the six batters we wanted, and he [Smith] was keen on a new challenge." Kraigg Brathwaite says he would have batted: "Looks a good pitch." Confirms the three debutants: Kavem Hodge, Justin Greaves and Shamar Joseph. "I want to lead from the front and let these guys follow. We have prepared well and it's all about action." Here's a reminder of sides <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?batting_fielding_first=2;class=1;filter=advanced;ground=131;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;template=results;toss=1;type=team;view=results">winning the toss and bowling in Adelaide</a>.

Hugh: "Unseasonably cool day here (as a local from Adelaide). Will likely be opportunities with the new ball early but batting first and hanging in till the arvo will be the go. If Windies field, they'll have to nail their lengths early." <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/aus-vs-wi-1st-test-kraigg-brathwaite-expects-the-aamer-jamal-length-to-do-the-trick-for-west-indies-quicks-1416827">That as something Brathwaite spoke about yesterday</a> Ahan: "Boy, its good to have Cameron Green back. An underrated thing about him being back is that the quick bowlers are all playing IPL this year, and aren't getting any younger. Him taking the load off them is massive, and he bowls extremely well, and cleans up the tail with those yorkers as well." <b>9.10am</b> Will be interesting to see how <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/cameron-green-returns-to-australia-test-side-as-no-4-bat-after-tough-year-1416721">Cameron Green goes back in the Test side</a>. He's long been earmarked as the future No. 4. And here's Alex, settling into one of the best grounds in the world: "Good morning from a very cool Adelaide Oval. It is 17 degrees at the moment which is a significant change from the last two days where it has been 34 degrees. It is supposed to get up to 23 later this afternoon. It is overcast. There is a lot of live green grass on the pitch. Really interesting decision at the toss. Only one team has bowled first after winning the toss in Adelaide since 1992 and that was England in 2017. And only one team has ever won a Test in Adelaide after choosing to bowl first and that was West Indies in 1982. But if ever there is a day to bowl first in Adelaide, today might be the day." There are also some cap presentations going on in middle involving Brian Lara and Ian Bishop. Pandeyji: "Smith as a opener, I think this will bring his average down. Catastrophic decision by Australian cricket team." That feels a little over the top, but certainly will be interesting to watch how it goes. <b>9.00am</b> One of the big talking points of this series will no doubt be the future shape of Test cricket. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/aus-vs-wi-club-vs-country-in-cricket-no-quick-fix-to-bridge-gap-between-haves-and-have-nots-1416840">The funding model needs to be reworked if the playing field is to levelled</a>. As we settle in for today, also a great time to catch up with the latest episode of Around The Wicket. This week Neroli Meadows is joined by Lisa Sthalekar, Daren Ganga and Michael Clarke to look ahead to this series and discuss plenty else from around the game. Prakash Gautam: "As a Smith fan, it was depressing to see him not scoring the runs as his standard. So a new role, new excitement to his fans too. Can't wait to see him scoring in the test arena." <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/pat-cummins-reassures-cameron-bancroft-marcus-harris-over-test-futures-1416818">Everyone reckons he's excited</a> <b>8.55am</b> Plenty of new faces in the West Indies squad, and three of them are in line for debuts today. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/meet-west-indies-new-names-with-ian-bishop-the-seven-uncapped-players-in-australia-1416028">Find out a bit more about them here, with help from Ian Bishop</a>.

Kraigg Brathwaite and Tagenarine Chanderpaul opening. Brathwaite on strike. Three slips and a gully. No short leg. <b>1.50pm</b> Thanks Abhimanyu. Hello everyone. The players are about to come out for the anthems. Slightly unusual sight of Cameron Green is standing on his own metres away from the Australian team due to his Covid infection. Andy: "Pat Cummins was given godlike athletic ability, success on field, silverware, charm and good looks....all in exchange for a bad record with the coin toss. The devil no longer runs a hard bargain..." SammyT: "All this winter in Brisbane talk in hilarious. I think we had about 3 weeks of cold weather last year. Not exactly a winter wonderland. <b>1.45pm</b> This summer, it's been difficult pitches for batters in Australia, but that's something that has been welcomed by Pat Cummins.

And here is Alex, ready to take you through what can be an exciting first hour at Australia's fortress. William Norman: "fingers thawing out during qld winter - goodness me" So, it will be Kraigg Brathwaite and Tagenarine Chanderpaul up against the new ball. West Indies will want them to give them better starts than they did in Adelaide. Mark: "I think anotherPK is being a bit harsh about always putting tests on at The Gabba in January. We had one in 2019 and one in 2021 - neither of which were affected by rain, and the last one prior to that was 1968." Mark: "Another PK - I used to play cricket in the winter in Brisbane and I can assure you that it's not ideal. The darkness would start to set in around 4.45, and the cold weather in July-August went straight through you. The good thing was that you never felt a dropped catch in the slips until about 10 seconds later when your fingers thawed out!" <strong>1.30pm</strong> <b>West Indies win the toss and bat first!</b> Here are the XIs: <strong>Australia</strong> 1 Usman Khawaja, 2 Steven Smith, 3 Marnus Labuschagne, 4 Cameron Green, 5 Travis Head, 6 Mitchell Marsh, 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Pat Cummins (capt), 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Josh Hazlewood <strong>West Indies</strong> 1 Kraigg Brathwaite (capt), 2 Tagenarine Chanderpaul, 3 Kirk McKenzie, 4 Alick Athanaze, 5 Kavem Hodge, 6 Justin Greaves, 7 Joshua Da Silva (wk), 8 Kevin Sinclair, 9 Alzarri Joseph, 10 Kemar Roach, 11 Shamar Joseph "Why did they have to make both tests happen at the exact same time?

Mr Dent: "Any word on how the SA lad Head is feeling post-COVID? I was hoping if he missed out Australia might blood Weatherald" He has recovered and is set to play today. Cameron Green, however, did test positive on Wednesday so he will be using a different change room. YogeshGunaji: "Exciting day for cricket fans all over the world! Both AUS vs WI and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-test-championship-2023-2025-1345943/india-vs-england-1st-test-1389399/live-match-blog-1">IND vs ENG</a> matches are kicking off simultaneously. It's going to be a  thrilling day with back-to-back cricket action. Can't wait to see how these games unfold" AnotherPK: "I wish they wouldn't keep putting the Gabba test on at the end of the season. The average rainfall in Brisbane in January is 140mm, compared to 90mm in November. Mind you, winter months are very dry and mild and there's plenty of winter cricket played in Brisbane, so maybe the Gabba should host a winter test tournament instead (maybe after the Olympics)." <b>1.15pm</b> Australia have a perfect record in day-night Tests, winning all 11 they have played. Here is a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/brisbane-day-night-tests-asad-shafiq-heroics-and-pat-cummins-career-best-1417565">history of pink-ball Tests at the Gabba</a>.

What about the Pak series?" Both the series are part of the World Test Championship, which is exactly why Australia will be wary of rain playing spoilsport. While none of the previous four Tests in Australia have gone to Day 5, you never want to take anything for granted. So how will the weather play out? And can Alzarri Joseph and Kemar Roach step up their game in Australia, where they have struggled so far? And will Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith and Marnus Labuschagne go through a home summer without a Test century?

Here is what <b>Andrew McGlashan</b> has to say from the ground: "Afternoon from Brisbane, where there certainly won't be the need for three spinners in an XI. It's a sunny, warm afternoon and the forecast for the weekend is not quite as bad as it was a few days ago, so fingers crossed the weather doesn't play a huge part. The pitch has lost a significant amount of green over the last 24 hours. Much more straw-coloured now. Looks like a bat-first surface, but still wouldn't be a surprise if Pat Cummins opted to bowl should he win the toss. Barring any late drama, we know the two XIs: Australia unchanged and a debut for offspinner Kevin Sinclair. Promising expectations for the crowd, too, for the last Test of the season with up to 50,000 expected across the first two days." Carl Hooper will present Kevin Sinclair with his cap, Gnasher adds. <strong>1.02pm</strong> So, the final Test of Australia's home summer is upon us and Pat Cummins and co. will be looking to complete a 5-0 sweep with a win against West Indies over the next five days. West Indies are up against it, with their batters especially needing to find a way to get more runs. In the last game, though, West Indies were in the game for long periods and in no small thanks due to debutant Shamar Joseph. Will they push the hosts in this game? Weather may also play spoilsport with chances of rain increasing from day 2, with the worst of it expected over the weekend. Welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the second Test. I am Abhimanyu and I'll be bringing you all the action from the Gabba along with Alex Malcolm.
