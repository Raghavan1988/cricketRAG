Kusal goes! This is turning into embarrassing territory. Kusal just has not found any sort of timing and as he tries to launch this one over the square leg boundary, can only get a very imperfect connection that goes hiiiigh towards fine leg. Tristan Stubbs is down there, tracking it against the sunlight, but making sure he gets under it and completes the catch.
