Kusal Mendis is OUT! run out
run out (Sikandar Raza)
Kusal Mendis run out (Sikandar Raza) 46 (48b 6x4 0x6 92m) SR: 95.83
<strong>Is that run out? Mendis is walking</strong> even though it's referred upstairs. Raza looks to have sprung a surprise. Yes, Mendis is well short as the direct hit from midwicket connects. Was a length ball around off that was nudged from within the crease. Mendis took off for what seemed to be a regulation single. Maybe he didn't expect the throw to come at his - non-striker's - end. He slid his bat through but didn't dive. Great awareness from Raza.

Shahidi wanted to keep them below 250, and Sri Lanka look well set to go beyond that.

<strong>does him all ends up!</strong> Another change-up, this time on a length outside off. Mendis does not quite pick it and is extraordinarily early into the stroke. Hangs out his bat and spoons it straight to Noor at backward point. Might have held in the surface too, and Afghanistan have two wickets in quick succession!

A crucial wicket for Afghanistan but it might have come at a cost...

bouncer, and Kusal has holed out. This is angled in at his body, gets up to chest-high, and gets big on him as he attempts another big pulls shot. Takes the top edge and flies high towards midwicket, where the fielder gets under it with no big issues.
Excellent timing for that breakthrough. Two new batters in now. But that was an excellent innings from Kusal Mendis.

Akindu: "How many t2oi 100s does mendis have? Hopefully he makes it all the way here" If he gets there, it will be his first.This is already his highest T20I score

attempts a scoop, but the length is too full for that and Mendis adjusts to just get some bat to it. Swipes it out towards square leg and gets to the other end
