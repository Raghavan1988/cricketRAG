Shot: STEERED

One cheeky shot too many? Hits the deck hard and gets fierce bounce, the line is fifth stump, he backs away a touch into the leg side to make room and almost <strong>guided it straight to Smith at deep third</strong>

<strong>Deft touch and it races away to third man boundary! </strong>That is some shot. Wow. Sharp lifting ball on a tight off stump line and he is not ruffled by that, upper-cuts it to perfection

Good length but outside the marker on leg side and <strong>that'll be Tea</strong>. Pakistan showed good fightback but Australia with that prized scalp of Mohammad Rizwan have swung back things in their favour again and made it their session
Rizwan found his rhythm and was playing with authority until that one error against Pat Cummins, who produced the magic again and broke the partnership just before Tea. Rizwan will be gutted to miss out on a century but more importantly, Pakistan needed that partnership to grow further. Batters have looked a bit loose in their defense and often muddled in their thinking but Salman Ali Agha and Mohammad Rizwan batted superbly with a positive mindset and were dominating the bowlers in the lunch session. It's only the first day and there is heaps of time still left so Pakistan should back themselves to compete session by session and see how it goes. Will Salman Ali Agha bat smartly with the tail and get close to 300, perhaps? That will take some doing. Join Alex in 15 minutes for the start of last session Shahed: "Quite immature from Rizwan, He can see 4 players in the boundary line for this type of shot and yet he plays that shot. " "Adeel: "Someone told me that Amir Jamal is an All Rounder. Why isn't he there at the crease ?" Maybe Sajid was sent as a tea watchman Stephen: "Regarding slow over rates and lost overs, one thing the ICC need to do is be flexible with their breaks. We will lose 20 minutes to the tea break here where we would have play, then come back and have play rained out." Sheernali SG: "Soooo sad to see Rizwan missing out on a well-deserved ton... Did all the hard work, but undone by the 'captain-of-the-moment'." Zed: "It seems like if Pakistani batsmen had seen off the first hour of play with caution just like Aussies openers did in the last game, they'd be in much better position now. You don't need to be scoring at 4  RR all the time. This is what test cricket is about. "

<strong>Is that a drop?</strong> Back of a length, shapes away off the deck from outside off, playing away from the body and steers it to Usman who has indeed shelled a chance, kept a touch low and it was dropping on him. Always got to be alert in the slips

<strong>fabulous off drive just reaches the rope!</strong> Cummins went for the double bluff pitching full and he crunches an off drive and doesn't run. Just holds the pose. It only just trickled into the rope
