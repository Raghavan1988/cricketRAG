<strong>oh, hello!</strong> Lobbed up into the slot outside off, and Avesh pounces. Massive wind up after clearing his front leg and he smears this over wide long on!

Avesh strides out to bat. No helmet for him. Just a cap will suffice for now against the spinner. Markram stays around the wicket

fired in on a length on middle and off. Avesh is trapped on the crease and then plays all over it. Gets pinged on the pads

Helmet back on for Avesh. Williams might just test him out with a few short deliveries...

banged in short on off stump. Avesh gets into a bit of a tangle with his positioning but fends it into the off side, somehow

Avesh Khan is OUT! run out
run out (Mulder)
Avesh Khan run out (Mulder) 9 (9b 0x4 1x6 18m) SR: 100
<strong>that will be that! A run-out to end a stuttering innings! </strong> Right at the stumps and Avesh punches it down the ground to mid off. Hares off for a single that is simply not there and does not even ground his bat in the end. Mulder hit the stumps at the bowler's end, and Avesh was well short of his ground!
<strong>4:25pm</strong> And so, India stutter and stumble their way to 211. They were rocked early with Gaikwad departing off the second ball of the innings. Tilak Varma scratched around but could not get going either. There was a passage, especially when Rahul and Sudharsan were at the crease, when India would have thought that they would be able to get past the 250-run barrier. Once Sudharsan departed - after scoring his second consecutive fifty - India floundered, with Samson, Rahul and Rinku also falling in quick succession. Arshdeep and Avesh landed a few lusty blows to take India past 200, although at this stage, you feel South Africa will be the happier side at the break. Speaking of South Africa, Burger was superb, bagging three wickets and bowling 46 dots (out of 60). Hendricks, called in as a late replacement, was similarly impressive and picked up two wickets. Maharaj did his bit too, and extracted whatever assistance was on offer. As Burger said, they will be confident of chasing this down but will be wary of what the Indian bowlers did in helpful conditions just a couple of days ago. Sidharth Monga will be back with the run-chase in a bit. Do let us know what you feel about this score and if India have enough on the board. Pierre: "This will by no means be an easy chase. Always a tricky ground to chase on, and with the Indian bowling attack, all things are possible in the second innings. " Anon: "Considering SA's last three ODI innings against India, it may well be more than enough. " <b>Nandre Burger:</b> Every time you play cricket, you have to enjoy it. Bowling is the most enjoyable thing for me. (On the Gaikwad wicket) Good to see the review go my way for once. Took the learnings from the previous game. Was a quick turnaround and tried to get into the game as quickly as possible. (On the pitch) I think it is a good wicket, slightly two-paced. A bit of turn for Kesh but apart from that it was good. Confident (of chasing this total down).

back of a length outside off. Avesh clears his front leg and aims for the moon. Misses the ball by an absolute mile

play and a miss, but they scamper through for a bye.
Meanwhile in Indian wrestling, the former federation chief is under trial for assault, stalking and sexual harassment. On election day, when change was promised, he is back by proxy. This is the <a href="https://www.espn.in/wrestling/story/_/id/39160707/wfi-election-sanjay-singh-brij-bhushan-sharan-singh-victory-sakshi-malik-vinesh-phogat-bajrang-punia-wrestlers-protest" target="_blank">Empire striking back</a> as Olympic medalist Sakshi Malik quits the sport. <B>4.46pm </b> An excellent recovery from India after a sluggish middle phase. It looked like they'll huff and puff to 250, but Sanju Samson's 116-run third-wicket stand with Tilak Varma led the recovery. Sanju went on to bring up his maiden ODI century, and every other batter who came in from there on continued to sustain that momentum. Rinku Singh with an excellent cameo towards the end to give the innings a late lift as well. India's last 10 overs produced 93 runs. South Africa have quite a chase on their hands if they are to win the series. Hope to see you in 25 minutes. <b> Sanju Samson: </b> "Feels interesting, just going through with it. Feels an emotional one. There's been a lot of work I've been putting in physically and mentally over the past year. They bowled well with the new ball, as the ball got older it was getting difficult to bat. But we got momentum through my partnership with Tilak. Maharaj bowled really well.
