Tristan Stubbs c Shakib Al Hasan b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 0 (5b 0x4 0x6 9m) SR: 0
spooned to short cover! Looked like the ball stopped on to Stubbs. Well taken by Shakib diving forward, as he went low while the ball died on to him. A short-of-a-length ball from Sakib in the channel outside off, as Stubbs went pushing at it by riding the bounce. He presented the full face of the bat there, but I think the slowness of the pitch played a part in the ball just chipping off his bat
