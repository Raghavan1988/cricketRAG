Well then, where do we even start? South Africa could hardly have scripted a more perfect start to their campaign. They were all over Sri Lanka from the get-go and, really, never let their foot off the gas - or in this case never let Sri Lanka put their foot <em>on</em> the gas. Nortje with figures of 4 for 7 was the pick of the bunch.  Sri Lanka's batters will be very disappointed in their effort though, as they time and again fell going for ill-advised strokes on a slightly sticky wicket. Fidel will be back in a bit for the start of the chase.
