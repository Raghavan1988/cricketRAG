<strong>huge appeal, and given! Farooqi has two in two!</strong> Devilish in-swinging delivery, bowled very full on middle and leg. Mukasa is all at sea and plays down the wrong line completely. The ball kisses the back pad, and the umpire has no hesitation in raising his finger. Mukasa does not bother with the review, and Uganda are two down!

<strong>huge appeal, and Mukasa has three ducks in a row! He cannot buy a run at this T20 World Cup!</strong> Arm-ball, slanting into middle and off. Mukasa, having seen the last ball turn, thinks he can reverse sweep this. Does not account for the ball swerving in and gets rapped right in front. The finger goes up, and Mukasa's horror T20 World Cup continues!

<strong>10:15pm</strong> Right. We are back. Mukasa and Ssesazi will open the batting for Uganda. Mukasa, in particular, could do with a few runs, having registered two ducks in the tournament so far. Hosein will take the new ball for the West Indies. Around the wicket to Mukasa - here we go!

<strong>big turn!</strong> Flighted up on a length just outside off. Drifts in before gripping and ripping away past the outside edge
