[{"type": "HTML", "html": "<b>12.42 pm</b> Well, Jahangir decided to go for glory tapping a single for a century for himself. In the process, he left the tail exposed and he never gets back on strike. Netravalkar bowled next ball and Phillip lasts just two deliveries before being wiped out. It means Jahangir is stranded with six balls left unused in the USA innings. USA could have fetched another 15-20 runs had Jahangir been on strike. How crucial will those six unused deliveries be?"}, {"type": "HTML", "html": "Karan KC takes four wickets in his new ball spell which put USA in a massive hole. Jahangir helped USA claw out of it and has given USA a fighting chance with his century. Still, USA appear to be severely under par here based on how the pitches have played in Harare over the first two match days, especially with a short boundary on one side of the ground. Nepal will be heavy favorites to chase this down. Stay with us for the start of the reply when Ashish Pant returns to the commentary box."}]<b>12.42 pm</b> Well, Jahangir decided to go for glory tapping a single for a century for himself.
