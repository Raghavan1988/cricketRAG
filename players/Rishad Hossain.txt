We are really delighted that you could be here. Make sure you catch the series' third and last Twenty20 International at Prairie View, Houston, on May 25 at the same time. On behalf of Ranjith and the whole team, here is Rashad bidding everyone farewell until then. Good night. Aks: "Celebrations on from Fremont San Francisco California ... Yeeey boys ... Bring it on home team" <strong>Monank Patel:</strong> "Our bowlers did really good and we played with a fighting attitude. I am really proud of the boys. I think the way our bowlers bowled in the powerplay and especially in the last five overs, we used the condition really well and they got the wickets at the right time. I think if we win (on Saturday) and get the confidence leading to the World Cup, it will definitely help us." <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto: </strong> "I think it's very disappointing for us. We lost wickets I think in almost every overs in the middle. That is the main point I think we lost the match. (Preparation for the World Cup) Yes we didn't play very well to be honest. But I think it is a very good opportunity to have another match and execute our plans. I hope we can play some good cricket in the next match. I think it's not the problem with the skill. We should change our mentality and mindset. We didn't do well in the last two matches." <strong>Player of the Match Ali Khan: </strong> "I think it was a low scoring game and the wicket slowed down later in the innings. But a lot of credit goes to the bowlers. They really put in the effort and bringing their A-Game and try to restrict the Bangladeshi batters back. We took wickets on the crucial stages and that put the pressure back on the Bangladeshi batters. And a lot of credit goes to Saurabh as well. The way he bowled the 19th over, I think he gave away only 2-3 runs and picked up a wicket. Good over for him and that gave me more runs to defend and win the game in the end. (Last over plan) Mindset was to get the wicket. It's just one wicket to win. It's not like they have 3-4 wickets in hand. My plan was to back myself, back my strengths and try to get the wicket earlier. I tried the bouncer and the full option but they put the pressure back on me. Then I went back to my strength on full deliveries and thank God Alhamdulillah (Praise to The Almighty) I got the wicket. (Bouncer delivery) It was the last wicket and tailenders were batting.
