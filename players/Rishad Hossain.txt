Zimbabwe had a strong start to the game once more but was unable to sustain it. Towhid Hridoy and Jaker Ali took control of the match when Tanzid Tamim departed, hitting some beautiful shots all over the field. Hridoy scored his first T20I fifty, but Jaker Ali was only six runs short of his second fifty. With two yorker deliveries in the penultimate over--possibly the two best deliveries of the series so far--the outstanding Muzarabani dismissed both batsmen. Muzarabani bowled incredibly well, taking three wickets with just 14 runs conceded. The other bowlers didn't help each other out and were a little expensive. Join us for the run chase after a brief break. Sahriar : "From BPL/international matches, Jaker Ali seems to try too many things when he is sent earlier (And is really good at slog overs). And seeing how Rishad plays spin, if their position is swapped- then I feel Bangladesh could maximize the output from resource available." <strong>Zimbabwe requires 166 runs to win the match</strong>

<strong>Nicked and gone! </strong> Fuller length wide outside off, shuffles across and plays the ramp scoop, inside edges straight back to the USA skipper Monank Patel
The USA is ahead 2-0 in the three-match series against Bangladesh. We are really delighted that you could be here. Make sure you catch the series' third and last Twenty20 International at Prairie View, Houston, on May 25 at the same time. On behalf of Ranjith and the whole team, here is Rashad bidding everyone farewell until then. Good night. Aks: "Celebrations on from Fremont San Francisco California ... Yeeey boys ... Bring it on home team" <strong>Monank Patel:</strong> "Our bowlers did really good and we played with a fighting attitude. I am really proud of the boys. I think the way our bowlers bowled in the powerplay and especially in the last five overs, we used the condition really well and they got the wickets at the right time. I think if we win (on Saturday) and get the confidence leading to the World Cup, it will definitely help us." <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto: </strong> "I think it's very disappointing for us. We lost wickets I think in almost every overs in the middle. That is the main point I think we lost the match. (Preparation for the World Cup) Yes we didn't play very well to be honest. But I think it is a very good opportunity to have another match and execute our plans. I hope we can play some good cricket in the next match. I think it's not the problem with the skill. We should change our mentality and mindset. We didn't do well in the last two matches." <strong>Player of the Match Ali Khan: </strong> "I think it was a low scoring game and the wicket slowed down later in the innings. But a lot of credit goes to the bowlers. They really put in the effort and bringing their A-Game and try to restrict the Bangladeshi batters back. We took wickets on the crucial stages and that put the pressure back on the Bangladeshi batters. And a lot of credit goes to Saurabh as well. The way he bowled the 19th over, I think he gave away only 2-3 runs and picked up a wicket. Good over for him and that gave me more runs to defend and win the game in the end. (Last over plan) Mindset was to get the wicket. It's just one wicket to win. It's not like they have 3-4 wickets in hand. My plan was to back myself, back my strengths and try to get the wicket earlier. I tried the bouncer and the full option but they put the pressure back on me. Then I went back to my strength on full deliveries and thank God Alhamdulillah (Praise to The Almighty) I got the wicket. (Bouncer delivery) It was the last wicket and tailenders were batting. Just a thought that we bowl the short ball and sky it against the wind. We had the field set up for it. But it was a controlled shot in the gap and went for four so credit goes to the batter (Rishad). But then I came back to my strength and got the wicket." <strong>Presentation Ceremony: </strong> Faizan Ahmed : "@Praneeth: I just checked the profile of all USA players and found that not even half of half had played for India Under-19 team. Correct your facts bro." In Houston, Texas, at the Prairie View Cricket Complex, history has been made once more. Against Bangladesh, the host team came out on top in the series. Yet again, Bangladesh's top order faltered, with Soumya going for a golden duck. After a little while, Tanzid also left on an inexpensive score. Following that, Hridoy and skipper Shanto were able to create a partnership, and they geared up for the run chase. However, Shanto's suicidal run-out blunder between himself and Hridoy cost him his wicket. Mahmudullah and Hridoy also quickly chipped away their wickets. With Shakib Al Hasan picking up few boundaries, Bangladesh still had a glimmer of hope. However, they collapsed when they lost consecutive wickets of Jaker Ali and Shakib Al Hasan. All but Jasdeep and Harmeet bowled brilliantly for the USA throughout the innings. Over the innings, the other bowlers maintained a precise line and length. A few of excellent catches were made by the fielding unit, including a well-executed catch by Harmeet and a one-handed blinder by Netravalkar. Monank made a terrific fielding placement that limited the area available to the batters from Bangladesh. The USA players' collective effort was accumulating dot balls, and Bangladesh once more buckled under pressure. To put the United States back in the game, Netravalkar, Van Schalkwyk, and Ali Khan bowled effectively in the final overs while maintaining composure. Azweer : "Many Congratulations USA... Much more to come... Extremely delighted to see you win the series..." <strong>USA won the match by 6 runs</strong>

<strong>Nicked and gone! </strong> Fuller length wide outside off, shuffles across and plays the ramp scoop, inside edges straight back to the USA skipper Monank Patel
The USA is ahead 2-0 in the three-match series against Bangladesh. We are really delighted that you could be here. Make sure you catch the series' third and last Twenty20 International at Prairie View, Houston, on May 25 at the same time. On behalf of Ranjith and the whole team, here is Rashad bidding everyone farewell until then. Good night. Aks: "Celebrations on from Fremont San Francisco California ... Yeeey boys ... Bring it on home team" <strong>Monank Patel:</strong> "Our bowlers did really good and we played with a fighting attitude. I am really proud of the boys. I think the way our bowlers bowled in the powerplay and especially in the last five overs, we used the condition really well and they got the wickets at the right time. I think if we win (on Saturday) and get the confidence leading to the World Cup, it will definitely help us." <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto: </strong> "I think it's very disappointing for us. We lost wickets I think in almost every overs in the middle. That is the main point I think we lost the match. (Preparation for the World Cup) Yes we didn't play very well to be honest. But I think it is a very good opportunity to have another match and execute our plans. I hope we can play some good cricket in the next match. I think it's not the problem with the skill. We should change our mentality and mindset. We didn't do well in the last two matches." <strong>Player of the Match Ali Khan: </strong> "I think it was a low scoring game and the wicket slowed down later in the innings. But a lot of credit goes to the bowlers. They really put in the effort and bringing their A-Game and try to restrict the Bangladeshi batters back. We took wickets on the crucial stages and that put the pressure back on the Bangladeshi batters. And a lot of credit goes to Saurabh as well. The way he bowled the 19th over, I think he gave away only 2-3 runs and picked up a wicket. Good over for him and that gave me more runs to defend and win the game in the end. (Last over plan) Mindset was to get the wicket. It's just one wicket to win. It's not like they have 3-4 wickets in hand. My plan was to back myself, back my strengths and try to get the wicket earlier. I tried the bouncer and the full option but they put the pressure back on me. Then I went back to my strength on full deliveries and thank God Alhamdulillah (Praise to The Almighty) I got the wicket. (Bouncer delivery) It was the last wicket and tailenders were batting. Just a thought that we bowl the short ball and sky it against the wind. We had the field set up for it. But it was a controlled shot in the gap and went for four so credit goes to the batter (Rishad). But then I came back to my strength and got the wicket." <strong>Presentation Ceremony: </strong> Faizan Ahmed : "@Praneeth: I just checked the profile of all USA players and found that not even half of half had played for India Under-19 team. Correct your facts bro." In Houston, Texas, at the Prairie View Cricket Complex, history has been made once more. Against Bangladesh, the host team came out on top in the series. Yet again, Bangladesh's top order faltered, with Soumya going for a golden duck. After a little while, Tanzid also left on an inexpensive score. Following that, Hridoy and skipper Shanto were able to create a partnership, and they geared up for the run chase. However, Shanto's suicidal run-out blunder between himself and Hridoy cost him his wicket. Mahmudullah and Hridoy also quickly chipped away their wickets. With Shakib Al Hasan picking up few boundaries, Bangladesh still had a glimmer of hope. However, they collapsed when they lost consecutive wickets of Jaker Ali and Shakib Al Hasan. All but Jasdeep and Harmeet bowled brilliantly for the USA throughout the innings. Over the innings, the other bowlers maintained a precise line and length. A few of excellent catches were made by the fielding unit, including a well-executed catch by Harmeet and a one-handed blinder by Netravalkar. Monank made a terrific fielding placement that limited the area available to the batters from Bangladesh. The USA players' collective effort was accumulating dot balls, and Bangladesh once more buckled under pressure. To put the United States back in the game, Netravalkar, Van Schalkwyk, and Ali Khan bowled effectively in the final overs while maintaining composure. Azweer : "Many Congratulations USA... Much more to come... Extremely delighted to see you win the series..." <strong>USA won the match by 6 runs</strong>

<strong>cleverly done!</strong> Bumrah goes for the wide yorker but Rishad has an answer for it. Opens his bat face and steers it fine past the keeper!

Rishad Hossain c Patel b Dube 5 (5b 1x4 0x6) SR: 100
<strong>Dube gets a wicket!</strong> Slower ball on a full length outside leg. Rishad has a swing at it because, well, why not. Does not come to grips with the change in pace and miscues it. Axar comes running in from long on and seems to misjudge it initially. Holds his nerve in the end, though, and snaffles up a smart overhead catch!
