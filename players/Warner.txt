Flighted delivery, stumps to stumps line, gets behind the line and firmly blocks it. Smoothly done by Warner in the end and that'll be stumps
<strong>6pm</strong> So, they all go through that hassle just for one more over of action. Pakistan started the day in the worst possible fashion and lost Abdullah Shafique and, the debutant, Saim Ayub early in the piece. They were in dire straits, but Shan Masood tried to calm things down with a patient 35 and then threw his wicket away, which has been the case for him throughout this series. Babar Azam failed to capitalise on his start as well and was trapped lbw by none other than Pat Cummins. Thereafter, Mohammad Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha hauled the team out of doldrums; the wicketkeeper thumped 88 off 103, while Salman, after a valiant knock at the MCG, looked assured out there for his sparkling 53. Sajid Khan added 15, but then what happened was a rarity. Aamer Jamal played one of the most <strong>sensational innings</strong> of his life; stood tall against a star-studded bowling attack and made Australia's bowlers scratch their heads as he clobbered nine fours and four sixes in his 82-run entertainment extravaganza. Props to Mir Hamza, who gave him able support from the other end and faced 43 deliveries for his valuable seven-run contribution. Stick around and refresh the match page later because Danyal Rasool will bring you a piece on Mohammad Rizwan and Andrew McGlashan has something special in store about Aamer Jamal. Day's report will be up soon. Expect plenty more reactions coming your way. Game is beautifully poised for a thrilling second day. The <strong>last hurrah for David Warner</strong>--will emotions get the better of him, or will he sign off in his typical swashbuckling style? It should be another engrossing day of Test cricket. <strong>Join us tomorrow for day two</strong>. Until then, it's goodbye and goodnight from Rvel Zahid and Alex Malcolm

The players head to the middle. Warner and Inglis opening for Australia. Akeal Hosein has the new ball. Interesting option given Warner and Inglis both play left-arm orthodox very well. Deep long-on and deep square back for Warner on strike. Slip in. Hosein bowling with the wind. <strong>6.55pm</strong> It's a lovely night in Hobart. Weather has been good there this week. But the wind might play a part. Can often get a strong breeze at Bellerive which has an impact on batting and bowling. <strong>6.40pm</strong> David Warner becomes first Australian to play 100 internationals in each format. Only Ross Taylor and Virat Kohli have managed that feat for any other country.

There's some variables with the wind, and one side a bit big. Mitch has taken his mask off today. He's come back alright. If the game was yesterday he wouldn't have been able to play.

Hosein around the wicket. <strong>6.25pm</strong> Apparently this particular pitch has only been used once this summer, that was the WBBL final. Adelaide has been a great batting deck and a great chasing ground in the BBL this summer. <strong>6.20pm</strong> Australia's Under 19s are taking on India's Under 19s in the U19 World Cup final in South Africa today.

More from Gnasher: "Adelaide Oval was comfortably the fastest-scoring ground in this season's BBL at 9.18 runs per over. The next was Albury, which staged one game, then Hobart at 8.43." Frederick the g: "Is there a decent crowd in tonight? Interesting to monitor the Australian public following after white ball games have been behind a paywall" Doesn't seem that big at the moment Frederick. AR: "Akeal Hosein averages 22 and bats at 10. Crazy" West Indies bat deep. Australia certainly don't tonight with Zampa at No.8. <strong>6.05pm</strong> Josh Inglis on Fox: "The reverse laps have only come in the last couple of years. I've become more comfortable with it. I love trialing those things in the nets. You're weighing up the field and it's a bit of a calculated guess and you've got to take it on and back it in." Gnasher: "Adam Zampa listed at No. 8 tonight. Has never been higher than nine in his entire international career." <strong>6pm Toss</strong> West Indies have won the toss and <strong>will bowl first.</strong> <strong>Rovman Powell</strong>: "Batting in Hobart could have been better and we could have bowled a little bit better to our plans and our fielding let us down just a little bit. Today provides an opportunity for us to change that." <strong>Mitchell Marsh</strong>: "Sean Abbott has an injury so the home boy Spencer Johnson comes in for his first game at Adelaide Oval as an Australian cricketer so I'm sure the crowd will get behind him." <strong>West Indies</strong> Brandon King, Johnson Charles, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Shai Hope, Rovman Powell (c), Sherfane Rutherford, Andre Russell, Jason Holder, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph <strong>Australia</strong> David Warner, Josh Inglis, Mitchell Marsh (c), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Tim David, Matthew Wade (wk), Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson, Jason Behrendorff, Josh Hazlewood West Indies unchanged.

Joseph has played just T20 matches in his career in the CPL and is yet to take a wicket but new LSG coach Justin Langer clearly loved what he saw in the Test series against Australia. <strong>5.45pm</strong> Good evening and welcome to Adelaide for the 2nd T20I of a three-match series between Australia and West Indies. Australia hold a 1-0 lead in the series after a 13-run win <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/west-indies-in-australia-2023-24-1375837/australia-vs-west-indies-1st-t20i-1375850/full-scorecard">in Hobart</a> on Friday night.

<strong>8.29pm</strong> David Warner and Travis Head stride out. Oman players get into a final huddle. Warner will take strike first up.

Two slips in place Tony: "Warner first ball 6, heard it here first" <strong>8.23pm</strong> The teams line up for the national anthems. Cummins' omission this evening is around giving him some extra rest after the IPL and some long travel to reach West Indies, although <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-tim-paine-nathan-ellis-should-be-in-australia-s-first-choice-t20-attack-1435783">Ellis does have strong credentials</a> to be in the XI.

Do you reckon that's because it's a weak opposition and it wouldn't be worth risking Cummins to play him straightaway after he just linked up with the Aussie squad?" Yup, some rest for him is the likely reason behind him not starting today. <strong>8.20m</strong> Don't forget to keep checking in on Gnasher's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-oman-10th-match-group-b-1415710/live-match-blog">live report</a>, where he will bring you more detailed analysis with stats and more as the match progresses. Neal: "Even before a ball is bowled, I feel worried for Oman. Good luck to them, I hope they do better than expected!" sumit: "Players like Cummins and Green are on the bench. Be aware of this Aussie side." <strong>8.15pm</strong> We saw Travis Head push the limits of opening the batting in T20 playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2024. Will he continue in similar fashion for Australia? Like in the IPL, he will have a left-handed partner at the top! Rajat: "Does Oman have a blue jersey? That way I can know if this is going be a Head show!" Even if they did, I doubt they would bring it out today - if only to keep Head quiet! <b>8.10pm</b> So, Australia leave out Pat Cummins and Cameron Green, with Nathan Ellis starting ahead of their World Cup and WTC-winning captain. Oman, meanwhile, bring in Pratik Athavale for Naseem Khushi in a like-for-like change at the top. They have also added more batting depth, with Shoaib Khan coming in for Mohammad Nadeem. <b>8.05pm</b> Here are the teams: <strong>Australia:</strong> 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Nathan Ellis, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood <strong>Oman:</strong> 1 Kashyap Prajapati, 2 Pratik Athavale (wk), 3 Aqib llyas (capt), 4 Zeesham Maqsood, 5 Khalid Kail, 6 Ayaan Khan, 7 Shoaib Khan, 8 Mehran Khan, 9 Shakeel Ahmed, 10 Kaleemullah, 11 Bilal Khan <strong>8pm</strong> And it's toss time in Barbados. <b>Oman choose to bowl</b>. "It's a fresh pitch. Bowlers did well last game, they are more confident," their captain Aqib Ilyas says. Two changes for them. Mitchell Marsh says they would have wanted to bowl first as well. "Trying to stay awake at work after an early start, hopefully this game gets me through all the meetings, would love to see Aus hit 300 batting first." I wouldn't count on it too much, Jaison! Bridgetown hasn't been a high-scoring venue in the last few years, and Oman's spinners may not let Australia score that easily. <strong>7.50pm</strong> What's the key to captaincy in T20s? And is staying calm a strength for a leader? Pat Cummins tackles these questions and more in <a href="https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1434566/pat-cummins---you-can-worry-about-the-batter-or-you-can-think-about-what-you-as-a-bowler-can-do">this interview</a> with Nagraj Gollapudi. Also, don't miss out on the latest episode of the Around the Wicket podcast, featuring Australia's T20 World Cup-winning captain, Aaron Finch. <strong>7.45pm</strong> This will be Mitch Marsh's first major tournament as Australia captain. Alex Malcolm traces his <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-caring-and-resilient-mitchell-marsh-s-long-road-to-being-australia-captain-1435777">long road to leadership</a>. <strong>7.40pm</strong> Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting knows a thing or two about World Cups and how to win them.

That will be encouraging for another left-arm seamer who loves to bowl the new ball that Oman will be coming up against - Mitchell Starc. He tore it up at the back end of the IPL, with player-of-the-match performances in the two knockout matches. He will want to find his rhythm quickly this World Cup, after a below-par showing in the 2022 edition. <strong>7.30pm</strong> 2023 was a bumper year for the Australian men's team as they won the World Test Championship and the ODI World Cup. Today, they begin their quest to become the holders of the world titles in all three formats (the men's cricket Grand Slam, as Gnasher suggests in his <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-oman-10th-match-group-b-1415710/match-preview">preview</a>).

They have also added more batting depth, with Shoaib Khan coming in for Mohammad Nadeem. <b>8.05pm</b> Here are the teams: <strong>Australia:</strong> 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Nathan Ellis, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood <strong>Oman:</strong> 1 Kashyap Prajapati, 2 Pratik Athavale (wk), 3 Aqib llyas (capt), 4 Zeesham Maqsood, 5 Khalid Kail, 6 Ayaan Khan, 7 Shoaib Khan, 8 Mehran Khan, 9 Shakeel Ahmed, 10 Kaleemullah, 11 Bilal Khan <strong>8pm</strong> And it's toss time in Barbados. <b>Oman choose to bowl</b>. "It's a fresh pitch. Bowlers did well last game, they are more confident," their captain Aqib Ilyas says. Two changes for them. Mitchell Marsh says they would have wanted to bowl first as well. "Trying to stay awake at work after an early start, hopefully this game gets me through all the meetings, would love to see Aus hit 300 batting first." I wouldn't count on it too much, Jaison! Bridgetown hasn't been a high-scoring venue in the last few years, and Oman's spinners may not let Australia score that easily. <strong>7.50pm</strong> What's the key to captaincy in T20s? And is staying calm a strength for a leader? Pat Cummins tackles these questions and more in <a href="https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1434566/pat-cummins---you-can-worry-about-the-batter-or-you-can-think-about-what-you-as-a-bowler-can-do">this interview</a> with Nagraj Gollapudi. Also, don't miss out on the latest episode of the Around the Wicket podcast, featuring Australia's T20 World Cup-winning captain, Aaron Finch. <strong>7.45pm</strong> This will be Mitch Marsh's first major tournament as Australia captain. Alex Malcolm traces his <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-caring-and-resilient-mitchell-marsh-s-long-road-to-being-australia-captain-1435777">long road to leadership</a>. <strong>7.40pm</strong> Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting knows a thing or two about World Cups and how to win them. And he believes you need <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ricky-ponting-you-want-natural-winners-like-david-warner-at-world-cups-1436860">"natural winners" like David Warner</a> in the big competitions. Oman captain Aqib Ilyas, however, feels that <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-oman-captain-aqib-ilyas-wants-his-team-to-target-australia-with-spin-1436821">'once you're on the field, there's no big name.'</a> <strong>7.35pm</strong> Oman's last game was played here in Bridgetown, and Namibia's left-arm seamer Ruben Trumpelmann got enough movement early on to trap two batters lbw with inswingers off the first two balls. That will be encouraging for another left-arm seamer who loves to bowl the new ball that Oman will be coming up against - Mitchell Starc. He tore it up at the back end of the IPL, with player-of-the-match performances in the two knockout matches. He will want to find his rhythm quickly this World Cup, after a below-par showing in the 2022 edition. <strong>7.30pm</strong> 2023 was a bumper year for the Australian men's team as they won the World Test Championship and the ODI World Cup. Today, they begin their quest to become the holders of the world titles in all three formats (the men's cricket Grand Slam, as Gnasher suggests in his <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-oman-10th-match-group-b-1415710/match-preview">preview</a>). Against them are an Oman side who put on a determined show <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/namibia-vs-oman-3rd-match-group-b-1415703/full-scorecard">against Namibia</a> in their opening encounter of the T20 World Cup. Australia are favourites going into the match, but don't be too surprised if Oman trouble the 2021 champions - especially their spinners.
