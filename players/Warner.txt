Pakistan started the day in the worst possible fashion and lost Abdullah Shafique and, the debutant, Saim Ayub early in the piece. They were in dire straits, but Shan Masood tried to calm things down with a patient 35 and then threw his wicket away, which has been the case for him throughout this series. Babar Azam failed to capitalise on his start as well and was trapped lbw by none other than Pat Cummins. Thereafter, Mohammad Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha hauled the team out of doldrums; the wicketkeeper thumped 88 off 103, while Salman, after a valiant knock at the MCG, looked assured out there for his sparkling 53. Sajid Khan added 15, but then what happened was a rarity. Aamer Jamal played one of the most <strong>sensational innings</strong> of his life; stood tall against a star-studded bowling attack and made Australia's bowlers scratch their heads as he clobbered nine fours and four sixes in his 82-run entertainment extravaganza.

Alex Malcolm and Andrew McGlashan are with you in commentary tonight. The toss is coming in 20 minutes. Here is Gnasher's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/west-indies-star-power-returns-as-australia-assess-top-order-squeeze-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-1420278">series preview</a>.
