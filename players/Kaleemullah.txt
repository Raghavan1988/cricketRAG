Low full toss that Kaleemullah looks to work onside but ends up getting a leading edge, safely towards cover. <B>Australia win by 39 runs</b>
On that note it's a wrap from us. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-oman-10th-match-group-b-1415710/points-table-standings">Here's</a> how the tables look after this game. Australia go top of Group B on net runrate. But stay tuned as the action is not over for today, with Pakistan taking on hosts USA in Group A action. That match is much later though, starting in about 11 hours in Dallas, so be sure to join us for that. But for now on behalf Abhimanyu, Gnasher on report and the rest of the team, this is Madushka signing out! <B>Mitchell Marsh</b>: "Pretty close one in the end, but good to get a win first up. [Warner tempo] Everyone's gotta play a little bit different this tournament I think. We might get few wickets that are [good for batting] but that's the old T20 right? Someone batting through, and Davy delivered tonight. [Stoinis?] It was pretty special from him, took his time and then got going through the end of the innings. [Starc?] Yeah just a cramp, we just took him off as a precaution but he says he's fine. [Cob webs?] Not sure if was cob webs as much as different conditions. Things may look a little different on these sort of wickets, but I think that's exciting. We go on to England now and hopefully that'll be a good game with a good crowd." <B>Aqib Ilyas</b>: "Playing against a top side today was a great experience, especially following on from the Super Over last game. They played really well, but credit goes to our bowlers. Our bowlers can do really well on turning tracks and you could see one catch was messed up and then the over went for big runs. And then from there Stoinis performed. But credit to our boys, well done. [You said "don't be overawed by this Australian side?] The thing with the media is that they don't show the positive things we said about them, they only show the negatives. Obviously they're top players, we respect them as cricketers like we respect everyone, but when we come out on to the field no one is bigger than you. These wickets are tricky and it's not easy for anyone. For the first 14-15 overs we had a good grip on the game, but one fielding mishap and the game was taken away. [Stoinis?] We might have messed up the execution a bit. He was hitting straight pretty easily, and after hitting a couple of sixes I went to my bowlers and said it wasn't working. Because the yorkers were not landing as the ball was hard to grip with the sweat dripping on it. So then we went with a plan to bowl slower ones, shorter and let him try and clear the longer 74 metre boundary. That worked but by then the game was going away from us." <B>Marcus Stoinis</b> is unsurprisingly <B>Player of the Match</b>: "Yeah it was a nice start. Maybe a few cob webs for us but we're better for it, and nice that we got the win. And nice that I got to spend some time in the middle and have a bit of a bowl. [Pitch?] Yeah we'd lost a couple of wickets, was just looking to hit the ball and along the ground at the start, just keep it simple. Soak up the conditions a little bit. [harder to face spin or seam?] Spin I guess. Couple keeping low, couple spinning and not spinning. But with the new ball the quicks looked tough as well. [Always going to go hard after the 15th?] Not particularly. Davie and I spoke about targeting the first couple of balls of that next over and then you know, you get the first few away and you think to try and turn it into a big over." <b>12.17am</b> So a comfortable win for Australia, and one that was never really in doubt. Marcus Stoinis was the star of the show, as he followed up his 36-ball 67 with figures of 3 for 19. There were some nervy moments in the first half of the Australian batting effort, but Stoinis' 102-run stand with David Warner (56) changed the tide of the game, particularly on a slightly tricky surface. Then with the ball the Australians put up a professional performance, barely giving Oman a sniff of a chance. Oman for their part gave a good account of themselves both with bat and ball, but the enduring pedigree and experience of the Australians was alway going to prove telling.
