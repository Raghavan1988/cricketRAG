Final ball of the day coming up. Can Mahmudul keep it out? Does Rajitha have one last trick up his sleeve?

into the blockhole on middle and leg. Mahmudul picks it early enough and squeezes it out into the on side. <strong>And that will be stumps</strong>
<strong>5:40pm</strong> That brings us to the end of our coverage for day one. Madushka's report should be up shortly and if you missed out on any action, that should be your one-stop shop to recount all of it. We will be back tomorrow, nice and early as Sri Lanka look to tighten the screw and Bangladesh plot a fightback. Until then, this is goodbye from all of us. Take care! <strong>5:35pm</strong> An enthralling day of Test cricket. 13 wickets fell, Sri Lanka scored at more than four runs per over, and the Bangladesh bowlers, for two sessions, were pretty good. The hosts, though, will not be very pleased with the three wickets they lost in the final 45 minutes. Mahmudul, though, is still at the crease and with Litton, Shahadat and Mehidy to come, they will feel they can eat into Sri Lanka's total significantly. Speaking of Sri Lanka, they dominated the day post the first session. de Silva and Mendis led the way and they were then backed up by the fast-bowling pair of Fernando and Rajitha. The former trapped Shanto and Zakir lbw, while the latter got the better of Mominul courtesy a jaffa. This final passage of play has placed Sri Lanka ahead in this game, and if they can make the most of the morning conditions tomorrow, they might even be looking at a healthy first-innings lead. Bangladesh, on the other hand, would want their middle order to show as much resistance as de Silva and Mendis did.

<strong>hot knife through butter! Catch Lahiru Kumara if you can!</strong> Hard length on off. Extracts movement off the surface and this decks back sharply. Joy has no clue about it and is awfully late on the stroke, having been caught on the crease because of the length. Bat does not come down in time and he hears the death rattle soon after. Kumara is pumped, and wheels away in celebration. This is just what SL would have wanted before the close of play!
