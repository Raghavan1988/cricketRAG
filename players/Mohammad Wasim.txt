That'll do nicely for New Zealand; they bag the series 3-0. Length ball fires it on middle, Wasim muscles it down to long on and jogs through a run. New Zealand win comprehensively by 45 runs.
And that's a wrap from Dunedin. New Zealand were clinical today and Finn Allen made sure to cash in on his red-hot form. He left Pakistan in tatters with his blitzkrieg and Pakistan weren't consistent enough with their lines and lengths, and looked rusty. Once again, Pakistan batters found it tough to get on top of the bowlers, and many of their aerial shots went into the hands of fielders. We hope you've enjoyed our coverage. Until next time, it's goodbye from me, Rvel Zahid, on behalf of Thilak Ram Finn Allen: Trying to have a solid foundation, solid base and kind of built from there...picking my moments when to go and picking bowlers. it's about playing the ball on merit. And then you get where it's supposed to go. Mitchell Santner: Pakistan are a very good team and they've shown that when they've come here and wherever we play them. I think we have to talk about trying to do it for as long as he can and he did it for a long time today (on Finn Allen). It's nice to have (big) score on a small ground. But I guess the scoreboard pressure, (allows us to be) aggressive and then you know, try and get that run rate quite high. Congratulations to New Zealand on the series win and commiserations to Pakistan who end up on the losing side. Tim Southee did a splendid job once again and was good in both his spells. Lockie Ferguson bowled a magnificent spell after being brought in the side for this game, and Mitchell Santner, who was wearing the captain's armband in the absence of Kane Williamson, took 1/26 and didn't allow Pakistan to get off the hook. The highlight of the day was Finn Allen's 137, which is the seventh-highest score in T20Is (check what other records he broke above). He simply killed the game with that spellbinding knock. Pakistan couldn't address their middle-order issues, and their bowling was abysmal as a unit. Lots of areas of concern, but they have two more games to get it right and carry some confidence because it's a World Cup year, and every game is an opportunity to make amends, weed out issues, get the <em>jazba</em> back in the team and identify their best 11 before the showpiece event

Throws the kitchen sink at it, deceived him with the the slow shortish ball wide of off
Ali Sajjad: "In the three matches it is Pakistan bowling that has let them down. They should not be required to chase 200  targets. Not taking anything away from NZ's amazing batting effort but better bowling effort could have restricted them to lower scores." Sairabhk: "Fin Allen has become the another scary Ghost for Pak after Warner." Hussain : "So the problem is babar? What a joke, only consistent performer in the team. Babar does his job while rest failing time n again"

Muffled appeal for an lbw, touch short and snaked it on middle, hit him a bit high as they sneak a bye
Nasir Hussain: "Pakistan at-least had a set opening pair and an established number 3 in form of Fakhar , now it is a mess from top to bottom under Hafeez and Shaheen."
