Thanks Ashish. Not often that Lamichhane goes wicketless. We could be seeing it happen two matches in a row if current events hold. Should've had one in that last over but an extraordinary drop by Bhim Sharki at long-off. Basic skied chance on the boundary. The only thing more shocking than the drop was the shot played by Nisarg Patel. Bad cricket begetting bad cricket.

<strong>8:28pm</strong> The national anthems are done and we are almost in readiness. Ronak and Ssesazi to open the batting for Uganda. Boult with the new ball for NZ. Ronak was dismissed by Farooqi the last time he played. Watch out for some early swing. Slip in place - here we go! Mark : "I don't know why NZ keep taking Sodhi to tournaments when they hardly ever seem to play him, despite having more T20 wickets than any other spinner and a better strike rate than Santner. NZ's management, preparation, attitude and team selection have been woeful this tournament. Southee's dismissal in the last game just one of many instances." <strong>8:22pm</strong> Both sets of players walk out for their respective national anthems. The ground is not as packed as it was when New Zealand last played, but there are a few with Ugandan and New Zealand shirts on. The Ugandan national anthem is up first and it will be followed by the New Zealand anthem. <strong>8:15pm</strong> New Zealand resist the temptation to bring in an extra specialist spinner and that seems the right call, with Phillips and Rachin capable of supporting Santner if required. Uganda have made a couple of changes, meanwhile, with Mukasa, who endured a tough run at the top of the order, giving way to Ronak. Achelam also plays his first game of Uganda's campaign. <b>Glenn Phillips:</b> Coming to the Caribbean, playing in the CPL, whether it is the factor of the lights and with the dew factor, it is a different place to field from around the world. A bit of a struggle but we have had our opportunities to field under lights. No excuses and we just have to be better. (On going back to keeping and opening the batting) There are definitely ambitions to open the batting again. But I love playing in the middle order. Really enjoyed opening the batting, I have absolutely no ambition of going back to keeping (smiles), love my bowling too much. At the end of the day, it is about doing what we do best. The guys have to give their 100% and do their country proud, taking one step at a time. <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> New pitch today, and it is a pleasant evening, says Ian Smith.

<strong>8:28pm</strong> The national anthems are done and we are almost in readiness. Ronak and Ssesazi to open the batting for Uganda. Boult with the new ball for NZ. Ronak was dismissed by Farooqi the last time he played. Watch out for some early swing. Slip in place - here we go! Mark : "I don't know why NZ keep taking Sodhi to tournaments when they hardly ever seem to play him, despite having more T20 wickets than any other spinner and a better strike rate than Santner. NZ's management, preparation, attitude and team selection have been woeful this tournament. Southee's dismissal in the last game just one of many instances." <strong>8:22pm</strong> Both sets of players walk out for their respective national anthems. The ground is not as packed as it was when New Zealand last played, but there are a few with Ugandan and New Zealand shirts on. The Ugandan national anthem is up first and it will be followed by the New Zealand anthem. <strong>8:15pm</strong> New Zealand resist the temptation to bring in an extra specialist spinner and that seems the right call, with Phillips and Rachin capable of supporting Santner if required.

Patel is OUT! caught
c Rishad Hossain b Mustafizur Rahman
Nisarg Patel c Rishad Hossain b Mustafizur Rahman 2 (6b 0x4 0x6) SR: 33.33
Slower through the air wide outside off, Patel throws his bat and skies it high to backward point, Rishad settles underneath and completes the catch.
Gous got the USA off to a great start. The USA batting order fell apart like a house of cards once Gous departed. The pitch slowed down, making it difficult for USA batters to counter Mustafizur Rahman and the spinners. Corey Anderson attempted to turn things around, but he was unable to quicken his strokes and challenge the Bangladeshi bowlers. Mustafizur Rahman and Rishad Hossain both bowled exceptionally well. Given how the pitch began to act in the latter innings of the game, it should be a fascinating low-scoring contest, depends on how well the spinners bowl. Join us for the run chase after a brief break. Sohel: "I doubt BD can cross this target. It's not a easy to bat on this pitch." <strong>Bangladesh requires 105 runs to win the match</strong> First six-wicket haul for a Bangladeshi bowler in T20I.
