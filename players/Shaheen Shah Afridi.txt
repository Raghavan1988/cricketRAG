<strong>Slog sweep, into the wind... and Pakistan are all out!</strong> Phil Salt charges in from the fence as it hangs in the air, sets himself and takes a great catch. <strong>England win the second T20I by 23 runs, taking a 1-0 lead in the series.</strong> A professional performance from England, boosted by the return of Jofra Archer. For Pakistan, they were good in phases but find themselves with some familiar questions to answer...
That's all from us here. Here's <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/pakistan-in-england-2024-1385666/england-vs-pakistan-2nd-t20i-1385688/match-report>Matt Roller's round-up of all the action</A>. Can Pakistan bounce back in the third T20I or will England take the series with a game to spare? Join us in Cardiff on Tuesday to find out! <strong>6.07pm:</strong> Player of the match is England captain Jos Buttler: "I thought there were some great performances from everybody. On his form: "You always want to be playing well. I feel like I'm hitting the ball well, which is great." On Jofra Archer's return: "I thought he was brilliant. you can see the emotion, taking wickets again, is fantastic. He's not just going to be the Jofra Archer of old straight away, but a really positive performance. It's absolutely trying to get overs into Jofra but looking after him as well. I thought the whole bowling group was brilliant." <strong>6.03pm:</strong> "It was a par score," starts Babar Azam. "I think our bowlers bowled very well. Our batting had moments but we were not close to finishing well. If someone scored 40 or 50 then I think we'd have definitely have won this game. "Mostly we are flexible and everyone knows their role. Before the series we decided to go with these roles, so we're clear. The way Fakhar dominated after the early wickets fell. I think if me and Fakhar had batted for four or five more overs, then we could have won." On Imad Wasim, who took 2 for 19 after coming out of retirement: "He's a very clever bowler and his batting is improved. So it's very good for us." aariz: "At this point, it is evident that Saim shouldn't be playing until he really proves himself in some series after the WC. Mohammad Haris  to open with Rizwan or they should open the batting with Usman khan and Mohammad Rizwan and bring in Irfan Khan Niazi in the middle. I hope PCB and Kirsten hear this."

Shaheen Shah Afridi c Ravindra b Henry 1 (6b 0x4 0x6 9m) SR: 16.66
Short of a length, curving away outside off, <strong>chipped straight to Rachin Ravindra</strong> who the only fielder patrolling the cover region and he snaffles it down his throat with his shades on, cool catch by a cool man. Afridi tried to inject some impetus to the innings but it's been tough going because the bowling has been just too good and precise

Shadab Khan thought the best escape route was to counterattack, and he smashed 40 from 25 balls in a stand of 72 with Babar Azam. Babar had decided to play anchor, but struggled to 44 off 43 deliveries on a slow pitch. Eventually, it was a massive contribution of 23* from Afridi that helped drag Pakistan to a good score.

<b> seals victory with a six! </b> Shaheen has clobbered this way over wide long-on! Once again premeditates by taking a step across and then gets down on one knee to swing it with all his might. Got it right off the middle and it sailed away.
<b>2.10pm </b> Ireland have made a mighty good fist of this low total, but ran out of gas in the end as Stirling had no option but to turn to his spinners to make up for overs. They went all in with pace through much of the innings in search of wickets, and were well and truly in the game for most parts of their defence. Babar Azam stood like a rock and absorbed all the pressure, and was there in the end when the winning runs were hit. At one point, it seemed as if this was Ireland's game to lose. But the 33-run stand between Babar and Abbas brought them close, before Shaheen's big hitting sealed the deal. Not sure how morale-boosting this win is, but they'll now have to prepare to face the wrath of a nation whose anger has been bubbling up following their group stage exit. Already there's chatter that Babar may not continue as captain. There's a saga waiting to unfold once the team lands. For now, it's time for Alan and me to head off. Thanks very much for your company. Don't forget we've got two games coming up in less than six hours. Bangladesh take on Nepal, while Netherlands play Sri Lanka. At stake is the final qualifying spot for the Super Eights. <b> Shaheen Afridi is Player of the Match. </b> "Wicket was good for bowling, we just tried to strike early," he says. "Everyone was looking to bowl fuller, tried to hit our areas. That finish is good. We haven't played the kind of cricket our country demands, have a few areas to improve on. Crowd always come in and support us, they've done some throughout the World Cup. It's tough [the result] but thanks to the fans." <b> Paul Stirling, Ireland captain: </b> "Think so, played well I patches, start of the day didn't go terribly well, they put pressure on us early on. Proud of the fight we've shown, 30 for 5 to get that score, wasn't too far away. It's getting that balance right. T20 we probably haven't got that this time around. It's been a difficult couple of weeks, go back regroup and see if we can come back stronger." <b> Babar Azam, the winning captain: </b> "Yes we finished well, we took early wickets with the ball. With the bat we didn't finish well. Lost back to back wickets, got over the line in the end. I think with the bowling, conditions suit our bowlers, in batting few mistakes in USA, India matches, when you lose wickets pressure is on you. Let's see, what team needs, I'll be okay with it. Have a good bunch of players, we've to go home, chat and see where we lacked, and then come back. Couldn't finish off close games, as a team we weren't good as a team."

Shaheen needs to understand the importance of rotating also" Tahir : "It's amazing to see how many balls have missed. Some serious bowling by Ireland " Mashkoor Naqvi : "Saim factor: Till Saim presence Pakistan scored 92 runs on 68 balls, after his fall till 18th over end it only scored 59 runs on 50 balls.  Middle over syndrome hits again." Usmaan: "Shaheen coming ahead of Imad. Seriously??" SalmanKhan: "Pakistan might get away with this one but they seriously need to improve their performance in the middle over. It can cost us very important matches in the upcoming world cup.PS: Azam Khan should be rested forever." Ali Hasni: "Fakhar is mismatch on this position. Either he should open or wait for an opener to create space for him, else he will ruin his career" Areez: "Pakistan fans are way too over thinkers. Pakistani bowlers have the ability to defend this total" That was a fun first half. Spirited bowling from Ireland keeps Pakistan at 182/6, thanks largely to Saim Ayub's brisk 45 and a fifty from captain Babar Azam. Onslaught from Iftikhar and Shaheen down the order propelled the score to a respectable one. Craig Young was on top of his game and only conceded 27 runs in his spell, taking the key wickets of Babar Azam and Azam Khan. Ireland were brilliant in the field and that could be the difference in the end. Stay tuned for Pakistan's reply

And once again, using his bat like a swinging door, should hold his composure. Once again banged in short in the channel, tries to plonk him into the leg side but can't lay bat on it

Continues to pepper him with short mean stuff and Shaheen is left frustrated, carbon copy of the previous ball, same result, tried to tonk him over midwicket

Manufactures pace for himself and hoists him for six over long-off, gave him a charge and absolutely pummeled it. It was a slower back of a length ball outside off

Shaheen needs to understand the importance of rotating also" Tahir : "It's amazing to see how many balls have missed. Some serious bowling by Ireland " Mashkoor Naqvi : "Saim factor: Till Saim presence Pakistan scored 92 runs on 68 balls, after his fall till 18th over end it only scored 59 runs on 50 balls.  Middle over syndrome hits again." Usmaan: "Shaheen coming ahead of Imad. Seriously??" SalmanKhan: "Pakistan might get away with this one but they seriously need to improve their performance in the middle over. It can cost us very important matches in the upcoming world cup.PS: Azam Khan should be rested forever." Ali Hasni: "Fakhar is mismatch on this position. Either he should open or wait for an opener to create space for him, else he will ruin his career" Areez: "Pakistan fans are way too over thinkers. Pakistani bowlers have the ability to defend this total" That was a fun first half. Spirited bowling from Ireland keeps Pakistan at 182/6, thanks largely to Saim Ayub's brisk 45 and a fifty from captain Babar Azam. Onslaught from Iftikhar and Shaheen down the order propelled the score to a respectable one. Craig Young was on top of his game and only conceded 27 runs in his spell, taking the key wickets of Babar Azam and Azam Khan. Ireland were brilliant in the field and that could be the difference in the end. Stay tuned for Pakistan's reply
