" Ran: "Are the Sri Lankan convinced of having Matthews and Shanaka in the T20 team. Neither are great bowlers and Ok they did well in the last match. Matthews was far from convincing neither was Shanaka." --- It's certainly an ongoing debate in Sri Lankan cricketing circles, Ran. Shanaka, despite his poor ODI form, has shown up more often than not in T20s; his power-hitting lower down is also crucial to team balance.

Here come the Sri Lanka openers Nissanka and Avishka, with a blue and bright sky above them. And with that, enters Fidel to get it started. He'll be with you for the first half of the innings, but he's loaded with heavy lunch! <strong>2.25pm</strong> It is a <strong>"similar pitch"</strong> to the first ODI, says Russell Arnold.

Erangagu: "Sri Lanka currently has a well-balanced team, and the bench strength is the strongest it has been in a while." <strong>6:40pm</strong> Just the one change across both teams then. Sri Lanka have gone in unchanged, which is not really a surprise after their win in the opening game. Afghanistan, meanwhile, have included an extra batter in Zazai, meaning that Janat, Nabi, Naib and Omarzai will have to combine for eight overs (at least) between them. <b>Sri Lanka XI:</b> Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Dhananjaya de Silva, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Wanindu Hasaranga (c), Angelo Mathews, Dasun Shanaka, Maheesh Theekshana, Binura Fernando, Matheesha Pathirana <b>Afghanistan XI:</b> Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Hazratullah Zazai, Ibrahim Zadran (c), Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Najibullah Zadran, Karim Janat, Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi <strong>6:35pm</strong> <strong>Afghanistan have won the toss and they have elected to field first.</strong> <strong>Ibrahim Zadran</strong> says that the pitch looks similar and that they want to chase, hoping to execute their plans and arrive with a positive mindset tonight. Adds he is trying to enjoy his role as a captain. <strong>Wanindu Hasaranga</strong> says that they will be targeting a good powerplay and a score of around 180. <strong>6:25pm</strong> Matheesha Pathirana, who has risen to prominence in T20 leagues across the world over the past year or so, picked up the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-1st-t20i-1416077/full-scorecard">Player of the Match award in just his second T20I on Saturday.</a> With the T20 World Cup fast approaching, Sri Lanka will want him to keep hitting his straps and give them a genuine death-bowling option moving forward. <strong>6:15pm</strong> Sri Lanka's batting in the ODI series was a breath of fresh air, with Pathum Nissanka, in particular, shining. Most of the star cast is the same for the T20I series and they will be hoping for an encore tonight. Afghanistan, on the other hand, have a depleted bowling attack, with Mujeeb and Rashid missing. That, however, opens up an opportunity for the likes of Noor and Qais to stake a claim for a more permanent gig. <b>6pm</b> <strong>Sri Lanka versus Afghanistan, round two.</strong> The first round on Saturday featured two sides, throwing punches left, right and centre. And even though not all of those landed, the intent to dominate was quite evident. It began with <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sl-vs-afg-wanindu-hasaranga-sri-lanka-man-for-a-crisis-does-it-again-1421624">Wanindu Hasaranga being his all-action and counterpunching self</a> (as usual), before Ibrahim Zadran played a more sedate hand, keeping Afghanistan within touching distance during the run-chase. The knockout blow, though, was landed by Matheesha Pathirana, who picked up two wickets in the penultimate over and four across the innings to stifle the visitors. In a T20 World Cup year, the contest on Saturday was perhaps what both teams would have wanted. A bit of everything, ranging from the calculated to chaos, and a real test of how individuals react to pressure situations. Now, bring on round two. Between two inconsistent, possibly imperfect, yet, thrilling sides. For Afghanistan, this <em>is</em> their chance to keep the series alive. For Sri Lanka, a chance to sew up the series at the first time of asking. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the second T20I between <b>Sri Lanka</b> and <b>Afghanistan.</b> I am Shashwat Kumar and I will be your eyes and ears for everything that happens in Dambulla tonight. Hop on, this promises to be entertaining. Not just because of what is at stake, but also because neither side is going to be pulling any punches.
