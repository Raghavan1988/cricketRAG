more good bounce. This takes off off a back of a length. It's passing just over off, and Nissanka is lucky not to get glove to that. Carries nicely through to the keeper so there is some pace on this pitch.

Marco Jansen has the ball. Pathum Nissanka is facing up. Mendis is out there with him. Here we go. Amit: "Having followed Cricinfo since forever, this is the first time cricket is being played in the same time zone where I am. Welcome to USA T20 Cricket. You were long overdue. We promise to make it as exciting for you as it is for us." Muhammad fahim : "Tactical move from Sri Lanka to play nuwan thushara ahead of dushmantha chameera SA batters struggled against thushara in SA T20 league " It seems the more attacking option too. Chameera's control is often handy though, so I'm sure it would have been a tough choice. The teams, by the way, are deep into the national anthems. If you want to read about the two baby Malingas, by the way, the grand old warhorse of sling bowling himself <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/lasith-malinga-on-sri-lanka-s-two-baby-malingas-it-s-absolutely-mad-1434544">spoke about them </a>a couple of weeks back. Lasan Rashmika: "Sri Lankan batsmen have historically struggled against wrist spinners, making it a puzzling decision to omit Tabraiz Shamsi from the playing XI. Shamsi's ability to deceive with his variations could have been a game-changer, exploiting this known weakness and putting additional pressure on the Sri Lankan lineup. His exclusion seems like a missed opportunity to leverage a strategic advantage." Pathirana, by the way, is hoping to bowl a dozen yorkers per game. Big news re the SL XI is that t<strong>here are two round-arm slingers</strong>. Nuwan Thushara and Matheesha Pathirana both are in the XI, alongside the two frontline spinners - Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana. Plenty of other bowling options in the XI too, with Angelo Mathews likely to send some overs down, Dasun Shanaka a potential contributor, and Charith Asalanka and Kamindu Mendis also there if some extra spin is needed. <strong><b>Sri Lanka XI</b>: </strong>1 Pathum Nissanka, 2 Kusal Mendis (wk), 3 Kamindu Mendis, 4 Sadeera Samarawickrama, 5 Charith Asalanka, 6 Angelo Mathews, 7 Wanindu Hasaranga (capt), 8 Dasun Shanaka, 9 Maheesh Theekshana, 10 Matheesha Pathirana, 11 Nuwan Thushara <strong>South Africa XI</strong>: 1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Reeza Hendricks, 3 Aiden Markram (capt), 4 Heinrich Klaasen, 5 David Miller, 6 Tristan Stubbs, 7 Marco Jansen, 8 Keshav Maharaj, 9 Kagiso Rabada, 10 Anrich Nortje, 11Ottneil Baartman <strong>Baartman is in the XI and plays his first World Cup match</b> following some good showings at the SA20.

He threw his bat at it, but as has been the case right through these early overs, he underestimated the bounce (Baartman, like the other SA bowlers, is a tall man). Gets a thick edge and it flies pretty much directly to deep third, who barely moves a couple of metres. That pressure had been building.

As for Bangladesh, as Isam points out in his <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/bangladesh-vs-sri-lanka-15th-match-group-d-1415715/match-preview">comprehensive preview</a>, they've had a pretty rotten 2024 losing a home series to Sri Lanka earlier this year as well as their warm-up series to hosts USA. <B>6.35pm</b> Morning/evening folks, and welcome to the latest chapter in the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/why-sri-lanka-vs-bangladesh-is-like-large-men-fake-wrestling-each-other-in-too-tight-underpants-1424993">greatest rivalry known to man</a>. That's right it's Bangladesh v Sri Lanka part 4538634, and we're here for it - well at least I am…at 5 in the morning in Colombo. All those up with me from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, I admire your dedication. And for those from Dallas and the US of A tuning in, perhaps wondering what exactly this rivalry has in store, think Frazier v Ali but replace them with Krusty the Clown and Homer Simpson. This is Madushka Balasuriya and along with Abhimanyu Bose and Andrew Fidel Fernando (Live Report), we'll be bringing you all the action today!

Alright, Kusal Mendis and Pathum Nissanka are out in the middle. Vivian Kingma has the ball. Thanks Fidel, so with one eye on the goings on at Kingstown this looks to be yet another enthralling day of World Cup cricket. The teams are out there for the anthems. Play will be under way shortly, I'll hand over now to Madushka Balasuriya, who will take you through the first innings. How many players might be playing their last T20 World Cup match here? Angelo Mathews is the oldest guy on the park, at 37, but says he's made no serious decisions on his future yet. On the Dutch side, only Sybrand Engelbrecht is 35-plus. Shantha: "I am from London wake-up after work with out sleeping and supporting Nepal team to win against Bangladesh," That's a long day, Shantha. If you're wondering how that other game is going, Bangladesh are 57 for 5 after 10. Matt Roller's been busy on the NRR calculator: "Playing around with an NRR calculator to work out how on this is for the Dutch. If Nepal were to chase 121 with two overs to spare and Sri Lanka set Netherlands 161, they'd need to chase it down in the 15th over to qualify on NRR. So it'll be a tough ask - but Nepal are doing them a massive favour." <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>: 1 Pathum Nissanka, 2 Kusal Mendis (wk), 3 Kamindu Mendis, 4 Dhananjaya de Silva, 5 Charith Asalanka, 6 Angelo Mathews, 7 Dasun Shanaka, 8 Wanindu Hasaranga (capt), 9 Maheesh Theekshana, 10 Matheesha Pathirana, 11 Nuwan Thushara <strong>Netherlands</strong>:  1 Michael Levitt, 2 Max O'Dowd, 3 Vikramjit Singh, 4 Sybrand Engelbrecht, 5 Scott Edwards (capt, wk), 6 Bas de Leede, 7 Logan van Beek, 8 Tim Pringle, 9 Aryan Dutt, 10 Paul van Meekeren, 11 Vivian Kingma Both teams are unchanged from their last outing. 7pm: <strong>Netherlands win the toss and choose to bowl at St. Lucia</strong>. They feel more comfortable chasing. Sri Lanka's batting has also been weak, so perhaps that's played into the equation as well. Wanindu Hasaranga says he would have bowled first also. Aamir Jamal : "With some recent heated rivalry between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh I won't be surprise if Sri Lanka lose to Netherlands just to kick Bangladesh out of tournament. Sri Lanka has nothing to lose but they can make Bangladesh to lose. " Uhhh, don't think Sri Lanka would throw a match. Plus it's against the ICC code, and a whole load of ethical considerations. Roller has had a little adventure getting to the ground: "The ICC and CWI have arranged shuttle buses at most Caribbean venues and I tried one out tonight: one breakdown and one van helped out of a ditch later, I'm in situ. They're using the same pitch as last night with a slightly shorter boundary towards the Johnson Charles Stand." Akib: "Since Bangladesh is not playing well, I think Bangladeshi supporters will keep an eye on SLvsNED game as well in this eid day.Eid Mubarak" Yep, Bangladesh have just lost their third wicket inside the powerplay, <strong>6:55 pm</strong>: We await the toss, but while we do, it's worth looking back on Sri Lanka's campaign. They were blown away by South Africa in New York, lost handily to Bangladesh (though they did make it closer than expected), and then had their match against Nepal rained out. The whole thing's been pretty embarrassing for the team that won this tournament 10 years ago. Angelo Mathews, the only surviving player from that 2014 side, had <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/angelo-mathews-apologises-to-sri-lanka-for-poor-performance-1438928">this to say about</a> it. ** Waddup, welcome to our ball-by-ball coverage of Netherlands' match against Sri Lanka, in St Lucia. Sri Lanka are winless so far in the competition, and have no chance of making the Super 8s. Netherlands could still potentially make it - they need to win big here to get their Net Run Rate significantly higher, and also hope that Nepal beats Bangladesh in the match currently being played. Our guy at the ground Matt Roller says it's sweaty, but dry at the Darren Sammy Stadium. We should have a prompt start.

Mendis and Nissanka to open for Sri Lanka, Ngarava with the ball. <B>6:58pm</b> Alright the players are out in the middle and we're almost underway! Ajay: "Think Mathews' role in this team is as a firefighter like he demonstrated last game. It's an unglamorous role but experience tells in high pressure situations which is why Australia picked Smith in their T20 side and Labuschagne in the ODI side when people were questioning their inclusion " Joe: "SL does not have a great T20 side, lack of power hitters are the biggest issue , need batsmen to score about 10-12 runs per over in the last 10 overs , poor running and lots of dot balls are their demise in this format " Nuka: "Well as a short-term solution for SL's batting problems, I don't mind Matthews's inclusion but SL lacks firepower in the lower middle. main problem is these slow pitches will not produce power-hitters." --- Good point, Nuka. The word from SLC though is that there's a concerted effort to make the pitches a little batter friendly over the next year or so. That said, the wickets in the US might be slower and lower on occasion, so this preparation might not be the worst idea at the moment. <B>Pitch report</b>: "Pleasant evening in Colombo with a cool breeze blowing across," says Russel Arnold. "Boundaries are equal length all round, advice for the batters is to run the opposition ragged. Better pitch than we had for the first game. Even though it's on the drier side it's bound together nicely, ball will come on to the bat well. Bowlers will need to vary their pace. Win the toss and bat first, 160 is the number you want today." Ran: "I would give Liyanage a chance against a team like Zim, instead of Matthews." --- Think the squad selection here has given a pretty hefty clue as to the selectors' thinking ahead of the World Cup. We're unlikely to see much experimentation in the batting, at least not in T20s. Mustafa Moudi: "2nd ODI and 1st T20I - 3 of the 2 matches were closely fought by Zimbabwe by failed to end on the right side of the result. Yet on paper it looks like SL have completed dominated in all the white ball matches so far. Hope Zimbabwe finally gets their Well-Deserved Win !! " Ran: "Are the Sri Lankan convinced of having Matthews and Shanaka in the T20 team. Neither are great bowlers and Ok they did well in the last match. Matthews was far from convincing neither was Shanaka." --- It's certainly an ongoing debate in Sri Lankan cricketing circles, Ran. Shanaka, despite his poor ODI form, has shown up more often than not in T20s; his power-hitting lower down is also crucial to team balance. As for Mathews, the question is who are you keeping out to fit him in, and what does Mathews bring to the table? Experience, sure, but there are still question marks over his ability to be a consistent power-hitter. <B>Sri Lanka XI</b>: Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Kusal Janith Perera, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Angelo Mathews, Dasun Shanaka, Wanindu Hasaranga (capt.), Maheesh Theekshana, Dushmantha Chameera, Dilshan Madushanka <B>Zimbabwe XI</b>: Craig Ervine, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe, Brian Bennett, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza (capt.), Ryan Burl, Clive Madande (wk), Luke Jongwe, Wellington Masakadza, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava In terms of team news, Zimbabwe are unchanged, while Sri Lanka have brought in Dilshan Madushanka for Nuwan Thushara. The Shona Princ: "I hope Zimbabwe will ball 1st. Its normally easy for Zimbabwe to chase a target than to set one. What is the par score today? I believe the toss will be a factor in this game. " --- Well you called it, Shona. <B>Wanindu Hasaranga</b> says he would've batted first anyway had he won the toss, but that he wants his batters to take more responsibility. <B>Sikandar Raza</b> says the wicket doesn't look too hard or dry, that it looks a bit two-paced and will get better for batting as the game wears on. <B>6:28pm</b> Time then for the toss...<B>Zimbabwe have won it and will bowl first!</b> Sunday's game also wasn't without its fair share of off-field drama with Mathews stirring the pot post-game, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/angelo-mathews-blames-agendas-of-former-selectors-for-white-ball-wilderness-1416705">blaming "agendas" for his time spent out of the T20 side</a>. Whatever the case, it seems like the present set of selectors do indeed have Mathews in their plans ahead of May's World Cup, and they'll be hoping he builds on performances like that on Sunday. Andy D: "Are they playing on the same pitch?" --- Don't have the pitch report as yet Andy, but considering the pitch they played on Sunday was a new one there's a good chance it's the same one again today. As for Sri Lanka, familiar weaknesses reared up once more. In a middling chase the top order got out cheaply to heap pressure on the middle order, which in turn led to an excessive number of dot balls through the middle overs. It was only a late partnership between Angelo Mathews and Dasun Shanaka - two former captains - that would steer the hosts home. And that too came with a fair degree of fortune, with Mathews in particular benefitting from quite a few edges finding the boundary. With the World Cup just six months off and not much by the way of cricket in-between, Sri Lanka's top order needs to start finding consistency fast. We already touched on it a bit, but of all the highlights from Sunday, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/zimbabwe-in-sri-lanka-2023-24-1412536/sri-lanka-vs-zimbabwe-1st-t20i-1412542/match-impact-player">Raza's all-round display truly had it all</a>, and on another day it would have ended in sweet victory for the visitors. Raza knows better than most the despair of such harrowing losses, and he acknowledged as much after the game when said that even with such performances he would only be happy when Zimbabwean cricket was finally turned around for the better. Well to do that, his teammates are going to have to offer more than they did on Sunday. In fact throughout this tour Zimbabwe have had Sri Lanka on the ropes but repeatedly failed to press home the advantage. Can they go one better tonight? <B>6:15pm</b> Evening folks, and welcome to our coverage of this second T20I between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. In case you missed it, Sri Lanka are already 1-0 up courtesy the narrowest of victories, after a turning pitch, and a masterful hand with both bat and ball from Sikandar Raza, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/zimbabwe-in-sri-lanka-2023-24-1412536/sri-lanka-vs-zimbabwe-1st-t20i-1412542/match-report">had dialled the drama all the way up</a>!

Sri Lanka then lift the trophy as We Will Rock You blares in the background. It was certainly a rocking series, and a great one to kick off a heavy season of cricket - for Sri Lanka and the rest of the world. The Sri Lankans will be in action against Afghanistan for both red-ball and white-ball cricket in a few weeks, but more immediately the Under-19 World Cup is kicking off tomorrow. There's also tons of action in the SA20 and the BBL, so be sure to join us for all of that and more! But for now, it's a wrap from us.

The only explanation I have is that we take full responsibility as the players. We're trying our best but unfortunately when we need courage more than skills that's not there.

Unfortunately we're not training as professionally as we could be, including myself. We're not reading the game well and understanding the situation, and playing accordingly. We're not trusting our skills. Today's one of those days where Craig, myself and Sean had to play a lot of the overs and we couldn't. That had a ripple effect.

But they can hold their heads high, because despite the end result this was a very tightly contested series. This game though was as one-sided as it gets. Sri Lanka needed just 65 deliveries to surmount Zimbabwe's subpar total of 82. Pathum Nissanka, who had not been in the runs, ended on 39 off 23. Kusal Mendis was also in the runs with 27-ball 33. The win though was set up by the Lankan bowlers, with more than a little helping of loose strokeplay from the Zimbabwean batters.

And that's my cue to welcome Fidel to the comms seat. <strong>2.20pm</strong> Farveez Maharoof's pitch report from the ground: "Hot, muggy and sticky out here in Pallekele. But a slight breeze will make it better for the players. Pitch looks fantastic. Some grass covering. The hardness is what you expect here. Very very hard. Ball will come on to the bat and pacers will enjoy the bounce. Could seam and swing a little in the evening under the lights." Meanwhile, <strong>Shahidi</strong> said he is expecting some dew, which is why he opted to bowl first. Wants to restrict Sri Lanka under 250. <b>Kusal Mendis</b> said at the toss he would have batted first. <strong>2.10pm</strong> So, no Mujeeb or Qais Ahmad for Afghanistan, who will rely on Nabi and Noor for spin, while opting for two quicks in Farooqi and Fareed as well as two seam-bowling allrounders in Omarzai and Naib. Sri Lanka of course have their two spin spearheads in Hasaranga and Hasaranga, while Madushan, Madushanka and Chameera will give them plenty of pace to work with. Asalanka can, of course, also roll his arm over if needed and Liyanage can offer another seam option. <strong>2pm</strong> <strong>Afghanistan win the toss and bowl</strong>.

Today is the first of three games to be played at Pallekele. Afghanistan have the 2025 Champions Trophy to build to, having enjoyed their best performance in a World Cup in India last year. Sri Lanka, though, missed out on qualifying for next year's big event and their next marquee ODI tournament will be the 2027 World Cup and could be looking at this game to test their bench strength. Either way, we can expect some feisty contests, with Asian rivals often throwing up some thrillers. I am Abhimanyu, and along with Fidel, I'll bring you all the action today from Pallekele International Stadium.

He'd worked pretty hard on his batting last year, and had an excellent LPL with the bat. We just haven't seen him in quite some time. Noor Ahmad is in to bowl. Here's

he's been sent scorching through the covers first ball. This was full, and too wide, and Nissanka has seen too many balls now to miss out on that. That's all along the ground to the rope.

<strong>Finishes in style!</strong> Full and wide, Nissanka crashes a drive straight of the deep cover fielder and finishes off with a boundary. Nissanka finishes on 210, Sri Lanka finish on 381
<b>6.25pm</b> Pathum Nissanka became just the tenth man to score an ODI double-century and the first from Sri Lanka as his magnificent innings guided Sri Lanka to 381. Nissanka batted through the innings, first putting on a 182-run stand with Avishka Fernando. Another 100-plus stand followed with Sadeera Samarawickrama, and then he really raced through the gears to get to the double-century. Nissanka walked off to handshakes from the Afghanistan players, including captain Hashmatullah Shahidi, who will be pondering his decision to bowl first. Fareed Ahmad, after an expensive start, picked two wickets and bowled well in the death, but Nissanka adjusted to the slower balls to put on a brilliant assault in the end. Nissanka showed a different level to his game today, making this knock even more special. Afghanistan now have a massive job on their hands. Join Fidel in around half an hour for the chase as I try to catch a breath and just take in what we've just witnessed! That was, by the way, the twelfth men's ODI double-century, and now the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/most-runs-in-an-innings-216972">joint-fith highest ODI score by a batter in men's ODIs</a>. Also, a shout out to Vishal Bansal, who was the first to mention a Nissanka double-century, all the way back when he was in the 120s! SunilBsawta : "Nissanka had hit just 9 sixes in his entire ODI career. Now he has hit 8 in this one alone. Take a bow!" ErangaGune: "I wish Uncle Percy could have been here to greet Pathum at the Pavilion." Dima: "Glad I didn't jinx him! Well done Nissanka. First of many to come!"

Thanks Himanshu. (It was lamprais, if anyone was wondering) Farooqi is steaming in. Here come the Sri Lanka openers Nissanka and Avishka, with a blue and bright sky above them. And with that, enters Fidel to get it started. He'll be with you for the first half of the innings, but he's loaded with heavy lunch! <strong>2.25pm</strong> It is a <strong>"similar pitch"</strong> to the first ODI, says Russell Arnold. He says we might not get as high scores as we did in the last game, but believes that the ball could move around in the first "six to eight overs".

Thanks Himanshu. (It was lamprais, if anyone was wondering) Farooqi is steaming in. Here come the Sri Lanka openers Nissanka and Avishka, with a blue and bright sky above them. And with that, enters Fidel to get it started. He'll be with you for the first half of the innings, but he's loaded with heavy lunch! <strong>2.25pm</strong> It is a <strong>"similar pitch"</strong> to the first ODI, says Russell Arnold. He says we might not get as high scores as we did in the last game, but believes that the ball could move around in the first "six to eight overs". "Who is going to make 200 today?" --- I'm sure both teams will, Asanka Janarabe <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>: 1 Avishka Fernando, 2 Pathum Nissanka, 3 Kusal Mendis (capt, wk), 4 Sadeera Samarawickrama, 5 Charith Asalanka, 6 Janith Liyanage, 7 Wanindu Hasaranga, 8 Maheesh Theekshana, 9 Asitha Fernando, 10 Pramod Madushan, 11 Dilshan Madushanka <strong>Afghanistan</strong>: 1 Rahmanullah Gurbaz, 2 Ibrahim Zadran, 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), 5 Ikram Alikhil (wk), 6 Azmatullah Omarzai, 7 Gulbadin Naib, 8 Mohammad Nabi, 9 Noor Ahmad, 10 Fazalhaq Farooqi, 11 Qais Ahmad <strong>2.03pm</strong> Here comes news: <strong>Sri Lanka win the toss and bat</strong>. Both sides make a change each: <strong>Asitha in for Chameera</strong>, and <strong>Qais in for Fareed</strong>. Nissanka's unbeaten 210 off just 139 balls attracted plenty of attention, and made Madushka Balasuriya ask: Pathum Nissanka, Sri Lanka's first double-centurion? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-pathum-nissanka-scores-double-century-in-first-odi-1420503">Who'd have thought?</a> Nissanka made history by <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/pathum-nissanka-hits-first-double-century-for-sri-lanka-in-odis-1420492">eclipsing even Sanath Jayasuriya</a>, forcing our statsman Sampath to get into action too.

superb on-drive. He's in lovely touch this series, obviously. This is not super full, and it's pitching outside off, and he's shuffled to off a little bit, and hit that so sweetly past the non-striker for four.

back of a length ball, hits him on the pads but it's turned down by the umpire. Big discussion going on about whether a review needs to happen, <strong>and they do review</strong>. This jagged in from wide of off stump, and beat Pathum's shot, but it hits him quite high - low on the thigh pad, and his feet are in the air also. And height is the problem. <strong>Ball tracking shows it going over the top. </strong>

<b>6.59pm</b> Farooqi has the new ball in hand. One slip in place. Over the wicket to Nissanka. <b>6.51pm</b> The teams are out for the anthems. Nishtar: "AFG is taking from the WI's calypso all stars' template. Strike rate over stability - hard hitting till 9, floating batting order over fixed - spin hitters, lhb/rhb combos, flexible bowling options - 8 guys to do the lifting. Without Rashid and Mujeeb, though, feel one of the openers have to take it deep." Yup, although they will have the advantage of having a target in front of them. Akindu: "Want to see Dasun back in form and striking the ball. Thats half the reason im even watching this :)" Abdul Aziz Shoj: "It is a revenge day, Afghanistan should win this T20I series against Sri Lanka to answer the Test and ODI series losses." <b>6.50pm</b> Tino Mawoyo in his pitch report: "Pitch looks like a really good one. Weather is very nice, lovely strong breeze across the stadium. Nice grass cover, but very thin glades of grass, so it's quite dry. There may be movement under the lights. But there can be turn later on. But it looks like a good batting surface." He says he would bat first here, so maybe a good toss to lose for Sri Lanka? <b>Ibrahim Zadran</b> says they wanted to bowl first because they don't know how the pitch will behave here so they want to get a feel of it by bowling first. <b>Wanindu Hasranga</b> says he would have also bowled first, but says the balance of his teams means, he is not too worried about losing the toss. He says he expects the batters to continue their form from the ODI series. <b>6.45pm</b> So Hasaranga, Theekshana, Binura Fernando and Pathirana will form Sri Lanka's bowling attack, with Mathews, Shanaka, DDS and Asalanka all capable of chipping in as well. Gulbadin Naib will continue at No. 3 after excelling in the role in India. Qais and Noor will lead Afghanistan's spin attack, and Omarzai will likely have a bigger role in the powerplay with Mujeeb not available. <b>6.35pm</b> <strong>Afghanistan win the toss and bowl!</strong> <strong>Sri Lanka XI:</strong> Nissanka, Mendis (wk), de Silva, Samarawickrama, Asalanka, Mathews, Shanaka, Hasaranga (capt), Theekshana, Binura, Pathirana <strong>Afghanistan XI:</strong> Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim (capt), Naib, Omarzai, Najibullah, Nabi, Janat, Qais, Noor, Farooqi, Naveen Junaid Anwar: "Hasarange, 98 T20Is wickets in 61 matches,he is a premier T20I bowler along with Rashid Khan ofcourse." Indeed! <strong>6.20pm</strong> This series will serve as an opportunity for both teams to fine-tune before the T20 World Cup in West Indies and USA in June. According to Sri Lanka's T20 captain Wanindu Hasaranga, they are <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sl-vs-afg-1st-t20i-sl-bowling-holds-key-for-wanindu-hasaranga-in-world-cup-year-1421458">among the best bowling outfits in the world</a>, and that aspect will hold key for them. As one of the best leg-spinners in the game, Hasaranga of course is a crucial cog of that unit. Afghanistan, meanwhile are not only without Rashid Khan, whose recovery from a back surgery continues, but will also not have the services of Mujeeb Ur Rahman with <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/rashid-khan-continues-recovery-mujeeb-ur-rahman-out-ahead-of-sri-lanka-t20is-1420873">a hand injury ruling him</a> out of the series.

Nishant kesharw: "Is it the first T20I to be played at this venue?" Well, Sri Lanka hosted India for three women's T20Is in June, 2022. But yes, this will be the first men's T20I to be played at this venue. <strong>6.05pm</strong> Sri Lanka took the one-off Test, despite a strong fightback from Afghanistan. Then Sri Lanka whitewashed the visitors in the ODIs. But now we turn to the format where Afghanistan are at their best, and can give Sri Lanka a run for their money. Welcome to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of the first T20I between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. I am Abhimanyu and I'll be bringing you all the action from the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium today.

He says he would bat first here, so maybe a good toss to lose for Sri Lanka? <b>Ibrahim Zadran</b> says they wanted to bowl first because they don't know how the pitch will behave here so they want to get a feel of it by bowling first. <b>Wanindu Hasranga</b> says he would have also bowled first, but says the balance of his teams means, he is not too worried about losing the toss. He says he expects the batters to continue their form from the ODI series. <b>6.45pm</b> So Hasaranga, Theekshana, Binura Fernando and Pathirana will form Sri Lanka's bowling attack, with Mathews, Shanaka, DDS and Asalanka all capable of chipping in as well. Gulbadin Naib will continue at No. 3 after excelling in the role in India. Qais and Noor will lead Afghanistan's spin attack, and Omarzai will likely have a bigger role in the powerplay with Mujeeb not available. <b>6.35pm</b> <strong>Afghanistan win the toss and bowl!</strong> <strong>Sri Lanka XI:</strong> Nissanka, Mendis (wk), de Silva, Samarawickrama, Asalanka, Mathews, Shanaka, Hasaranga (capt), Theekshana, Binura, Pathirana <strong>Afghanistan XI:</strong> Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim (capt), Naib, Omarzai, Najibullah, Nabi, Janat, Qais, Noor, Farooqi, Naveen Junaid Anwar: "Hasarange, 98 T20Is wickets in 61 matches,he is a premier T20I bowler along with Rashid Khan ofcourse." Indeed! <strong>6.20pm</strong> This series will serve as an opportunity for both teams to fine-tune before the T20 World Cup in West Indies and USA in June. According to Sri Lanka's T20 captain Wanindu Hasaranga, they are <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sl-vs-afg-1st-t20i-sl-bowling-holds-key-for-wanindu-hasaranga-in-world-cup-year-1421458">among the best bowling outfits in the world</a>, and that aspect will hold key for them. As one of the best leg-spinners in the game, Hasaranga of course is a crucial cog of that unit. Afghanistan, meanwhile are not only without Rashid Khan, whose recovery from a back surgery continues, but will also not have the services of Mujeeb Ur Rahman with <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/rashid-khan-continues-recovery-mujeeb-ur-rahman-out-ahead-of-sri-lanka-t20is-1420873">a hand injury ruling him</a> out of the series. You can have a look at the squads <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-1st-t20i-1416077/match-squads">here</a>. Nishant kesharw: "Is it the first T20I to be played at this venue?" Well, Sri Lanka hosted India for three women's T20Is in June, 2022. But yes, this will be the first men's T20I to be played at this venue. <strong>6.05pm</strong> Sri Lanka took the one-off Test, despite a strong fightback from Afghanistan. Then Sri Lanka whitewashed the visitors in the ODIs. But now we turn to the format where Afghanistan are at their best, and can give Sri Lanka a run for their money. Welcome to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of the first T20I between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. I am Abhimanyu and I'll be bringing you all the action from the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium today.

<strong>6:58pm</strong> We are all in readiness. Nissanka and Mendis to open the batting, like they did on Saturday. Farooqi with the new ball for Afghanistan. This powerplay could be crucial in shaping this contest. <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> A fresh strip is being used today. 15 wickets fell to pace the other day, and the grass covering is patchy. A few cracks are also visible and Russel Arnold reckons it could be two-paced and a touch sluggish. He says he would have batted first had he won the toss. Erangagu: "Sri Lanka currently has a well-balanced team, and the bench strength is the strongest it has been in a while." <strong>6:40pm</strong> Just the one change across both teams then. Sri Lanka have gone in unchanged, which is not really a surprise after their win in the opening game. Afghanistan, meanwhile, have included an extra batter in Zazai, meaning that Janat, Nabi, Naib and Omarzai will have to combine for eight overs (at least) between them. <b>Sri Lanka XI:</b> Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Dhananjaya de Silva, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, Wanindu Hasaranga (c), Angelo Mathews, Dasun Shanaka, Maheesh Theekshana, Binura Fernando, Matheesha Pathirana <b>Afghanistan XI:</b> Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Hazratullah Zazai, Ibrahim Zadran (c), Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Najibullah Zadran, Karim Janat, Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi <strong>6:35pm</strong> <strong>Afghanistan have won the toss and they have elected to field first.</strong> <strong>Ibrahim Zadran</strong> says that the pitch looks similar and that they want to chase, hoping to execute their plans and arrive with a positive mindset tonight. Adds he is trying to enjoy his role as a captain. <strong>Wanindu Hasaranga</strong> says that they will be targeting a good powerplay and a score of around 180. <strong>6:25pm</strong> Matheesha Pathirana, who has risen to prominence in T20 leagues across the world over the past year or so, picked up the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-1st-t20i-1416077/full-scorecard">Player of the Match award in just his second T20I on Saturday.</a> With the T20 World Cup fast approaching, Sri Lanka will want him to keep hitting his straps and give them a genuine death-bowling option moving forward. <strong>6:15pm</strong> Sri Lanka's batting in the ODI series was a breath of fresh air, with Pathum Nissanka, in particular, shining. Most of the star cast is the same for the T20I series and they will be hoping for an encore tonight. Afghanistan, on the other hand, have a depleted bowling attack, with Mujeeb and Rashid missing. That, however, opens up an opportunity for the likes of Noor and Qais to stake a claim for a more permanent gig. <b>6pm</b> <strong>Sri Lanka versus Afghanistan, round two.</strong> The first round on Saturday featured two sides, throwing punches left, right and centre. And even though not all of those landed, the intent to dominate was quite evident. It began with <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sl-vs-afg-wanindu-hasaranga-sri-lanka-man-for-a-crisis-does-it-again-1421624">Wanindu Hasaranga being his all-action and counterpunching self</a> (as usual), before Ibrahim Zadran played a more sedate hand, keeping Afghanistan within touching distance during the run-chase. The knockout blow, though, was landed by Matheesha Pathirana, who picked up two wickets in the penultimate over and four across the innings to stifle the visitors. In a T20 World Cup year, the contest on Saturday was perhaps what both teams would have wanted. A bit of everything, ranging from the calculated to chaos, and a real test of how individuals react to pressure situations. Now, bring on round two. Between two inconsistent, possibly imperfect, yet, thrilling sides. For Afghanistan, this <em>is</em> their chance to keep the series alive. For Sri Lanka, a chance to sew up the series at the first time of asking. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the second T20I between <b>Sri Lanka</b> and <b>Afghanistan.</b> I am Shashwat Kumar and I will be your eyes and ears for everything that happens in Dambulla tonight. Hop on, this promises to be entertaining. Not just because of what is at stake, but also because neither side is going to be pulling any punches.

Fahim: "We have seen in the past how Taskin and Mahmudullah came back strongly after being given a reality check. Saifuddin also showed glimpses of that in the last BPL. Mustafizur needs that too.

Definitely more of a batter - has had some decent scores recently. Bowls gentle seam. The big news for Bangladesh is that Mustafizur Rahman is not playing. Tanzim Hasan Sakib plays instead.

Pathum Nissanka c Soumya Sarkar b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 36 (28b 5x4 1x6 51m) SR: 128.57
caught at wide slip off the toe edge! What a weird dismissal. Tanzim strikes again. This is a short ball, wide-ish of off stump. Nissanka tries to pull this in front of square on the legside, but gets the timing wrong. The ball hits the toe of the bat and goes straight into the midriff of Soumya Sarkar at about third slip. Tempted to say that's an inspired field placement, but no one expects toe-ended shots to go there!

Plenty of grass and cracks appearing," says Farveez Maharoof. "Win the toss, get the runs on the board, 280-285. I reckon bringing in a spinner could be a master call. They will get some service. But pitch looks good for batting." <B>Chris Silverwood</b> also spoke to the host broadcaster: [Challenges?] Heats going to be the big one cos it's a day game. The wicket will be drier too cos it's a used wicket. [Madushanka?] Big miss and of course disappointed for him, he was bowling well. And he was looking at the IPL as well. But yeah, huge miss for us. <B>Chandika Hathurusingha</b> spoke with the host broadcaster before the match: "We have a really a good home record. The fact is we're playing in different kind of wickets now, we're looking at the bigger picture. I don't think Bangladesh have played on these kind of wickets for a long time. We looked at home advantage before but now we're thinking of...there's nothing on the line in the near future, so we're thinking of a way forward towards 2027. We're trying get wickets where bowlers and batters are both in the game. That's a new thing, so we're learning as well. Getting all this information, who are the players best suited for our game plan. Looking at all those little details, pretty happy with how this series has gone. [losing Tanzib and Litton] Litton's experience always counts, you never know that kind of player can always come in and play a match-winning innings at any time. Saying that, he's been out of form for some time, so we need to move on from him unfortunately. Sakib bowled brilliantly so far, but we are replacing him with our most experienced bowler so happy with that." Theshan: "It is a bad decision to bat first. Bangladesh seamers were bowling well and SL openers have not played well against them. Good chance to BAN to take initials grip" Saleque Sufi : "Bangladesh must something out of box to try and win the match and the series. With Liton not there Bangladesh must give Anamul Bijoy a go . Rishad should come in place of Taijul. Experienced Mustafiz should return . Winning the toss and batting first should be the way to go as dew will not be a factor today " --- Missed this from Saleque earlier. Care to share the lotto numbers while you're at it? Beastmaster: "Beast warriors! That is what I like about this SL team. Their body language us good, confident and tough. Loved the way Wanindu walked in the other day. No smile. Just business. Same with Asalanka.  Will be great leaders" Bpagur: "I hope Rishad will play in place of Taizul today." --- You got your wish. And I'm sure all those in Chattogram and around Bangladesh will be hoping to see more of those fireworks Rishad showcased in the T20s.

But while Sri Lanka's pace stocks have diminished, Bangladesh's are in fine fettle. They've accounted for 14 of the 17 Sri Lankan wickets to fall in the series, and have been on an upward trajectory as of late. But with the impressive Tanzim Hasan Sakib missing out today, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/can-bangladesh-pace-attack-recapture-old-brilliance-vs-sl-in-a-decider-1425197">Isam asks if the home side's seamers can keep up the good work</a> on a true surface in Chattogram?

With dew not a factor in the final game, it'll be intriguing to see if Sri Lanka lean further into spin and bring back Maheesh Theekshana or replace Madushanka with the pace-bowling allrounder Chamika Karunaratne.

Corker! Lovely shape away off a good length, squares up Nissanka and has him poking at this away from the body. Beats the edge.
Okay, Mushfiq seems okay to continue. Aeman: "Hopefully there won't be any new dramas on the field today. Better team wins. " --- Ah, always nice to see such unbridled optimism early in the day. Mushfiqur however has hurt himself attempting to collect that last one, which has struck him flush on the thumb. He's in quite some pain and is getting some treatment.

The fact is we're playing in different kind of wickets now, we're looking at the bigger picture. I don't think Bangladesh have played on these kind of wickets for a long time. We looked at home advantage before but now we're thinking of...there's nothing on the line in the near future, so we're thinking of a way forward towards 2027. We're trying get wickets where bowlers and batters are both in the game. That's a new thing, so we're learning as well. Getting all this information, who are the players best suited for our game plan. Looking at all those little details, pretty happy with how this series has gone. [losing Tanzib and Litton] Litton's experience always counts, you never know that kind of player can always come in and play a match-winning innings at any time. Saying that, he's been out of form for some time, so we need to move on from him unfortunately. Sakib bowled brilliantly so far, but we are replacing him with our most experienced bowler so happy with that." Theshan: "It is a bad decision to bat first. Bangladesh seamers were bowling well and SL openers have not played well against them. Good chance to BAN to take initials grip" Saleque Sufi : "Bangladesh must something out of box to try and win the match and the series. With Liton not there Bangladesh must give Anamul Bijoy a go . Rishad should come in place of Taijul. Experienced Mustafiz should return . Winning the toss and batting first should be the way to go as dew will not be a factor today " --- Missed this from Saleque earlier. Care to share the lotto numbers while you're at it? Beastmaster: "Beast warriors! That is what I like about this SL team. Their body language us good, confident and tough. Loved the way Wanindu walked in the other day. No smile. Just business. Same with Asalanka.  Will be great leaders" Bpagur: "I hope Rishad will play in place of Taizul today." --- You got your wish. And I'm sure all those in Chattogram and around Bangladesh will be hoping to see more of those fireworks Rishad showcased in the T20s.

Mustafa Moudi : "Fun Fact: On this day in 2018, Bangladesh lost the Nidahas Trophy Final to India with Dinesh Karthik's last ball six. Hope they chase this match so that nothing like that happens tonight!!" --- Mustafa waking up this morning and choosing violence, I see. Mustafa Moudi : "Results so far in this tour - SL, Ban, SL (in T20Is), Ban and SL (First 2 ODIs). So according to the Alternative Pattern Bangladesh should win this decider and take the ODI Series !!"

But while Sri Lanka's pace stocks have diminished, Bangladesh's are in fine fettle. They've accounted for 14 of the 17 Sri Lankan wickets to fall in the series, and have been on an upward trajectory as of late. But with the impressive Tanzim Hasan Sakib missing out today, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/can-bangladesh-pace-attack-recapture-old-brilliance-vs-sl-in-a-decider-1425197">Isam asks if the home side's seamers can keep up the good work</a> on a true surface in Chattogram? The visitors meanwhile have also been dealt a pretty hefty blow with <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/dilshan-madushanka-to-miss-rest-of-bangladesh-tour-and-initial-stages-of-ipl-for-mumbai-indians-1425182">Dilshan Madushanka ruled out of</a> the final game with a hamstring injury. With dew not a factor in the final game, it'll be intriguing to see if Sri Lanka lean further into spin and bring back Maheesh Theekshana or replace Madushanka with the pace-bowling allrounder Chamika Karunaratne. As things stand, it's 1-1 heading into the decider, though the momentum might just be with the home side after their<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/bangladesh-vs-sri-lanka-2023-24-1419819/bangladesh-vs-sri-lanka-2nd-odi-1419828/match-report"> fighting display in a losing cause</a> last time out. Not only did they pick up some late wickets to make for a nervy finish, their <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bangladesh-tail-swings-against-sri-lanka-to-bring-relief-1425106">wagging tail, as Isam points out</a>, was also able to push them towards a competitive total when a middling one seemed all but certain. <B>9.10am</b> Morning folks, and welcome to our coverage of the final ODI between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It's a day game we've got before us today, and it'll be Madushka and Rashad bringing you all the action. Toss and team news shortly.

Swing and a miss first up! This was full outside off, Nissanka goes for the big drive first up but is beaten on the outside edge by the angle across

<B>Taskin has Nissanka!</b> Having been beaten on the outside edge a couple of times, this one goes on with the arm and it raps Nissanka flush on the front knee roll. Perhaps this was worth a review, but they opt not to go upstairs. Bangladesh have the big fish

Corker! Lovely shape away off a good length, squares up Nissanka and has him poking at this away from the body. Beats the edge.
Okay, Mushfiq seems okay to continue. Aeman: "Hopefully there won't be any new dramas on the field today. Better team wins. " --- Ah, always nice to see such unbridled optimism early in the day. Mushfiqur however has hurt himself attempting to collect that last one, which has struck him flush on the thumb. He's in quite some pain and is getting some treatment.
