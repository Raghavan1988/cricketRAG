he gets a wicket off his first World Cup delivery. This was fullish, wide, and Nissanka's eyes lit up. He threw his bat at it, but as has been the case right through these early overs, he underestimated the bounce (Baartman, like the other SA bowlers, is a tall man). Gets a thick edge and it flies pretty much directly to deep third, who barely moves a couple of metres. That pressure had been building.
