<strong>big appeal, and given!</strong> The first time really that Fernando has gotten his line right, and he reaps the rewards straightaway. On a length, pitches just outside off and nips back into Zakir. He is caught on the crease and ends up playing inside the line. Gets pinned on the back leg in front of off stump, and Chris Gaffaney raises his finger. <strong>Zakir wants to have another look, though. No bat involved. Ball Tracking comes up and it shows the ball would have clipped the top of middle and off stump. Umpire's Call and Zakir has to go!</strong>

Hello, everyone. Spin first up. And it will be the captain to start things off. Around the wicket to Zakir. Beastmaster: "Expect a lot of short ball bowling from Asitha and Lahiru with some in-swing to the right handers. Build up frustration and then nab the wicket...would seem the plan" The players are making their way out on to the field. I'll hand over to Shashwat who will take you through the first hour. Russel Arnold at the pitch report says that while there are some cracks opening up on a good length for the fast bowlers, but there's plenty of runs on offer still. Sri Lanka will need to be persistent with their lines and lengths if they are to make headway, he thinks. When we start, opener Zakir Hasan will be partnered by Taijul Islam, who is there as a nightwatcher, but in the first Test he had been among Bangladesh's best batters. An innings of significance from him will help Bangladesh get on their way on day three. The good news from our correspondent at the ground Mohammad Isam is that the skies are bright enough for a prompt start. We should get going in a few minutes. Saleque Sufi : "The primary task today of Bangladesh batsman is occupying the crease ,grind and graft . One or two batsmen of top five must bat deep. Two long partnership may assist Bangladesh posting 400 plus in the innings. But primary task is scoring 332 for avoiding follow on.  " <strong>9:15am</strong>: Waddup folks. Welcome to our coverage of the third day of the second Test between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka are obviously in control at the moment, and will look for those wickets that will break this match open for them. Kamindu Mendis, who made 92 not out yesterday, even thinks there will be some turn from this surface today, to assist Prabath Jayasuriya and co. But Bangladesh batting coach David Hemp has said Bangladesh <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ban-vs-sl-2nd-test-kamindu-mendis-expects-spin-to-play-a-bigger-role-from-day-three-1427221">are still thinking of winning this match</a>. If the pitch remains good for batting today, and they take the game deep, that's certainly not out of the realms of possibility.

<strong>vociferous appeal, not given by Rod Tucker!</strong> Very full outside off. Zakir thinks he can drive at this and gives it the lot. The bat definitely hits the ground but the question is whether it also grazed the outside edge on its way through. <strong>Sri Lanka go upstairs to find out. Clear gap between bat and ball, and the sound was indeed of the bat hitting the ground. Sri Lanka lose a review!</strong>

what a delivery! Viswha has knocked him over. That's jagged in a long way to take out leg stump, and Sri Lanka have a breakthrough. Vishwa delivered this from quite wide on the crease, from over the wicket to the left-hander. The ball pitched on a length, and Hasan was guilty of not moving his feet, so when the ball darted back at him, he was in a terrible position to adjust. In the end it slips between pad and bat to flatten leg. Vishwa is ecstatic. He'd set that up by bowling the ones that went away a touch in the last couple of overs.
