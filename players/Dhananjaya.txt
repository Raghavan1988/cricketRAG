Dhananjaya de Silva st †Litton Das b Rishad Hossain 21 (26b 1x4 0x6 51m) SR: 80.76
<strong>What a ripper!</strong> Beautiful legbreak, drawing the batter forward. On a length around middle, the ball spins away sharply as DDS gets forward looking to slog. Litton is on the money behind the stumps and de Silva's back foot is outside the crease. And an odd innings from de Silva comes to an end and it's thanks to that man Rishad again!

<b>12:06pm</b> Sri Lanka, after 11.1 overs, got themselves to 40-1, which given the assistance on offer for the bowlers, seemed a decent start. But then, they collapsed and their middle order fell like a heap of cards, slipping to 57-5 in no time. De Silva and Mendis have since gotten together and have arrested that particular slide, although the visitors still have plenty of work to do to get to a competitive first-innings total. For Bangladesh, Khaled Ahmed was the pick of the bunch, bagging three wickets. Shoriful could not make early inroads but returned to account for Chandimal with a carefully-crafted leg-slip trap. Rana was also very impressive with his pace but started leaking runs towards the end. Definitely Bangladesh's session, and they will hope they can break this partnership post lunch, and expose Sri Lanka's long tail. Madushka will be back in about half an hour for the restart.

Khaled, who has been Bangladesh's most successful bowler today, returns

back of a length outside off. de Silva goes back and pushes it into the vacant cover point region. Good urgency shown to get back for two

full and erring onto the pads. de Silva brings his wrists into play and clips it through mid wicket. Taijul has to hare to his left from deep square leg, slides across and cuts it off
<strong>2:42pm</strong> The over-rate has been shocking, the cricket anything but. 125 runs came in the second session, with a majority of them arriving in the first hour. de Silva and Mendis capitalised on the loose deliveries Bangladesh served up, and rattled along at a brisk rate. Bangladesh losing the plot was also down to how proactive the two batters were, and they have now been together for 32.4 overs, scoring 160 runs in the process. Lots to ponder for Bangladesh over their cup of tea. They lacked incision, penetration and discipline in the second session. They did pull the run-rate back in the second half but never looked likely to break this partnership. They will have to rectify that at the earliest and ensure that their early-morning exploits do not go to waste. Madushka will be back in a bit with the third and final session of the day.

Just five minutes to go in this session. A few running repairs for de Silva, with his right forearm seemingly causing him trouble. de Silva good to go now. Khaled to bowl what should be the last over before tea dhanu: "These two batting without any pressure WOW"

tossed up full outside off. de Silva skips down and times it exquisitely past extra cover. Mid off gives chase and reins it in, saving a run in the process

Alright, the players are in the middle, we're almost back underway. Mehidy to start things off gautham Menon : "Are these matches a part of WTC?if so, Bangladesh will be penalized for slow over rate" --- Yes they are, and yes they will if it doesn't improve pretty drastically. <B>2.59pm</b> Welcome back folks, the final session should be getting underway soon. Sri Lanka have fought back splendidly after that horror morning session, but seeing how well this wicket is looking for the batters they will know the work is still only half done. For Bangladesh, just one wicket and they'll know they're into the tail.

good length on off, shuffles down the track and gently eases this down to long-on
