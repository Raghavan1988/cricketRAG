Madushka will be back in about half an hour for the restart."}]<b>12:06pm</b> Sri Lanka, after 11.1 overs, got themselves to 40-1, which given the assistance on offer for the bowlers, seemed a decent start. But then, they collapsed and their middle order fell like a heap of cards, slipping to 57-5 in no time. De Silva and Mendis have since gotten together and have arrested that particular slide, although the visitors still have plenty of work to do to get to a competitive first-innings total. For Bangladesh, Khaled Ahmed was the pick of the bunch, bagging three wickets. Shoriful could not make early inroads but returned to account for Chandimal with a carefully-crafted leg-slip trap. Rana was also very impressive with his pace but started leaking runs towards the end. Definitely Bangladesh's session, and they will hope they can break this partnership post lunch, and expose Sri Lanka's long tail. Madushka will be back in about half an hour for the restart.
