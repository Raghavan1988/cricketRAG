<b>and he has struck first ball</b>! First ball in Test cricket and he's removed Conway! Shamar Joseph, you have company. With the angle from around the wicket, he pitches it right on good length, moves it in sharply and traps the batter right in front with sharp movement. Conway goes down to consult Latham, it's not a short chat and eventually Conway decides to walk back. The replays say it was umpire's call on hitting the top of the stumps. What a start!

<b>gone!</b> Paterson provides the early breakthrough. It was a lovely delivery. Angling in a touch from around the wicket, forcing Conway to play at it this time before moving away just enough to take the outside edge. A regulation catch for the keeper
