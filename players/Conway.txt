Obviously, being here first time at this level, just the exposure to the quality players. It has done wonders for the game back home. The whole country has been following our progress, staying up late to watch games. hopefully it is a platform we can build on. I have tried to interact as much as I can with the top players, trying to pick their brain. Asking questions like what they did to get better. We are looking forward to what happens next for us, and hopefully this can help get it done. (On the opposition teams they have interacted with) They have absolutely loved us and I want to say thank you to them. They have been happy when we have done well and happy to share words of encouragement when we have not done well. They have helped us wherever they can. Nice to see how the boys have gone, especially in the field. The two young fast bowlers have inspired a lot of kids back home. They come from a humble background and to see them do what they do, there are a lot of kids dreaming about it as well. As a cricketer and as a player, that is what you hope for - to leave a mark and make it a better place. It is a very humbling experience and hopefully, Ugandan cricket can learn from this and build on this platform. (On how the West Indian fans have received them) They love us here and we love them back. We tell them we have a massive following back home. Very happy they have been receptive of us. <b>Tim Southee, Player of the Match:</b> It was obviously a pretty clinical performance, nice to get a win. (On the pitch) It has been a little tricky, trying to bring the stumps into play as much as possible. Extremely disappointed to play ourselves out of the tournament. You look at the side, plenty of experience and we were not at our best in the first two games. We have a proud record in World Cups in the last ten years and it has now come to an end. (On if he has another World Cup left in him) Got a nice break leading into this World Cup. Body is feeling well, I love playing for New Zealand. Dream to play cricket and I still enjoy it, so you never know. <strong>10:50pm</strong> No real surprises in the second innings. New Zealand hunt down their target comfortably and they now have two points to show for their toil in the Caribbean. Conway played a couple of splendid cover drives and that will have pleased him and the team management, even though Allen could not stay till the end. They might have lost but across 5.2 overs, Uganda showed that they have massive potential in the bowling department. Kyewuta and Miyagi troubled the Kiwi batters at different points but the fact was that they just did not have runs on the board to put any pressure. Another steep learning curve for Uganda, but another experience that should help them in the long-run. The Ugandan players go over to their fans and show their appreciation for the support. A nice touch after a tough but historic T20 World Cup campaign.
