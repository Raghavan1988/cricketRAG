<strong>soft dismissal! Farooqi has two!</strong> Full outside off and this seems to stick in the surface ever so slightly. Conway pokes at it but the lack of pace means he cannot keep it down. Chips it straight to short extra cover, and NZ are two down inside three overs!

<strong>big appeal, not given!</strong> Fullish in and around off. Conway gets down on one knee and swipes across the line. Misses completely and gets struck on the left shoulder. Afghanistan are very confident and once Kumar Dharmasena says no, they go upstairs. Couple of things to check here. Did the ball spin enough to take it past off stump and did it strike Conway in line. <b> No bat involved but the impact is outside off. Conway stays and Afghanistan lose a review!</b>

<strong>that will be that! New Zealand get on the board and they have iced this run-chase inside six overs!</strong> Short down leg. Conway uses the pace and the angle to help it past short fine leg. NZ cruise to a nine-wicket win, and they have points on the board!
<strong>11:15pm</strong> That will be a wrap from us. Not the end Uganda will have hoped for, but they finish their maiden men's T20 World Cup with a win, and that will be savoured for long, as will be the experience gained by playing against Afghanistan, New Zealand and the West Indies. Things will be a little more sombre in the NZ camp, given they missed out on the Super Eight. But now that they have points on the board, they will want to finish strongly in their last game. Hope you enjoyed our coverage, and we would love your company throughout the rest of the T20 World Cup. Until next time, this is goodbye from me, Sudeep, Vairavan and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care, folks! <b>Kane Williamson, New Zealand captain:</b> Guys were good. Obviously, there was plenty there in the surface and made life pretty difficult. Nice to do that job in the first half. Very tough, there is not a lot of control or ideas of method on how you identify six balls here and a match-up there. That is the difference between getting 110-115 and 80 or less. It has been unique, and nice to have done things a little bit better. (On having more teams at the World Cup and interacting with them) Great, you know. More the merrier, in terms of exposure at the highest level. The conditions have been an added challenge but having that exposure is always a great thing to learn from. (Weekend plans) Recover tomorrow and then train and play again. Same discussions again and being respectful of the conditions and the surface, and playing as well as you can. <b>Brian Masaba, Uganda captain:</b> It has been a wonderful experience for us. Obviously, being here first time at this level, just the exposure to the quality players. It has done wonders for the game back home. The whole country has been following our progress, staying up late to watch games. hopefully it is a platform we can build on. I have tried to interact as much as I can with the top players, trying to pick their brain. Asking questions like what they did to get better. We are looking forward to what happens next for us, and hopefully this can help get it done. (On the opposition teams they have interacted with) They have absolutely loved us and I want to say thank you to them. They have been happy when we have done well and happy to share words of encouragement when we have not done well. They have helped us wherever they can. Nice to see how the boys have gone, especially in the field. The two young fast bowlers have inspired a lot of kids back home. They come from a humble background and to see them do what they do, there are a lot of kids dreaming about it as well. As a cricketer and as a player, that is what you hope for - to leave a mark and make it a better place. It is a very humbling experience and hopefully, Ugandan cricket can learn from this and build on this platform. (On how the West Indian fans have received them) They love us here and we love them back. We tell them we have a massive following back home. Very happy they have been receptive of us. <b>Tim Southee, Player of the Match:</b> It was obviously a pretty clinical performance, nice to get a win. (On the pitch) It has been a little tricky, trying to bring the stumps into play as much as possible. Extremely disappointed to play ourselves out of the tournament. You look at the side, plenty of experience and we were not at our best in the first two games. We have a proud record in World Cups in the last ten years and it has now come to an end. (On if he has another World Cup left in him) Got a nice break leading into this World Cup. Body is feeling well, I love playing for New Zealand. Dream to play cricket and I still enjoy it, so you never know. <strong>10:50pm</strong> No real surprises in the second innings. New Zealand hunt down their target comfortably and they now have two points to show for their toil in the Caribbean. Conway played a couple of splendid cover drives and that will have pleased him and the team management, even though Allen could not stay till the end. They might have lost but across 5.2 overs, Uganda showed that they have massive potential in the bowling department. Kyewuta and Miyagi troubled the Kiwi batters at different points but the fact was that they just did not have runs on the board to put any pressure. Another steep learning curve for Uganda, but another experience that should help them in the long-run. The Ugandan players go over to their fans and show their appreciation for the support. A nice touch after a tough but historic T20 World Cup campaign.

(On if he has another World Cup left in him) Got a nice break leading into this World Cup. Body is feeling well, I love playing for New Zealand. Dream to play cricket and I still enjoy it, so you never know. <strong>10:50pm</strong> No real surprises in the second innings. New Zealand hunt down their target comfortably and they now have two points to show for their toil in the Caribbean. Conway played a couple of splendid cover drives and that will have pleased him and the team management, even though Allen could not stay till the end. They might have lost but across 5.2 overs, Uganda showed that they have massive potential in the bowling department. Kyewuta and Miyagi troubled the Kiwi batters at different points but the fact was that they just did not have runs on the board to put any pressure. Another steep learning curve for Uganda, but another experience that should help them in the long-run. The Ugandan players go over to their fans and show their appreciation for the support. A nice touch after a tough but historic T20 World Cup campaign.

Just eight runs needed now. Can NZ finish it off this over?

<strong>gorgeous!</strong> Half-volley outside off and that is right up Conway's alley. Springs onto the front foot and crunches it to cover point's left!
