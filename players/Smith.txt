Dave: "@ren: these guys aren't exactly slow. Steve Smith's test strike rate is higher than guys like Michael Slater or Shane Watson. A strike rate of around 50 is pretty normal for test cricket." Yep. His recent strike-rate is down on that. So that's the interesting part about it. I don't see it being an issue

A clinical performance from the hosts today. Shai Hope and Co will look to bounce in a couple of days at the SCG. Hope to see you for that. Thanks for joining for this one. I'm Ekanth signing off on behalf of my co-commentator, Hemant Brar, and our scorer, M Venkat Raghav. <strong>Xavier Bartlett, POTM</strong> Amazing way to start my career. Couldn't ask for more with that first wicket, hit the stumps. Lucky it came off. Was nice coming in with confidence, nice campaign with Heat. Happy to contribute here. Being captained by Smith was surreal having watched him play for ten years. Hayes: "A bonus point win for the Aussies. Excellent way to start the Tri-Series. Wait, they're still not bringing it back?" <strong>8:57pm</strong> An expected result but Australia will be pleased with Green stepping up at No. 3 and Smith continuing his form from the last Test. A few of their debutants were also on the top of their game. In the chase, it was Josh Inglis, smashing it to all parts after Travis Head fell early to a loose ball from Forde. He pounced on anything remotely short. There were five fours and a six in the 11 balls after fifth over. He pretty much toppled the opposition in the powerplay. He got out reversing but the onslaught allowed Cam Green and Steven Smith get into their work without any sense of pressure. The duo rotated strike with ease and used the big pockets on the ground well. Both of them finish with unbeaten 70s to hand Australia a 1-0 series lead.

advanced and drives on the up without great timing wide of mid-on! <strong>Game over!</strong>
<strong>5.55pm</strong> The game started at 2.30pm local time and the presentations are complete before 6pm. Australia have demolished West Indies to win the series 3-0. It was the fastest men's ODI ever played in Australia and the sixth fastest world wide. West Indies have some soul searching to do as their captain said. But two fresh squads with a host of different players will assemble for the T20I series which starts in Hobart on Friday. It will be a good glimpse into how both sides are shaping ahead of the T20 World Cup midyear. Thanks for your company in Canberra. <strong>5.42pm Presentation</strong> <strong>Player of the match and the series is Xavier Bartlett</strong>: "It's pretty insane. It's just great to get a taste of international cricket. To cap it off with a series win was great. There was still some pressure there [today] but I relaxed a little bit more and tried to enjoy it a little bit more and they came out alright again." <strong>Shai Hope</strong>: "Our batting let us down. It did for the entire series. We need to do some real soul searching to understand what's needed in certain conditions. You can't really put your finger on one thing in particular. The mindset has a lot to do with it, playing the situation. We just didn't bat as well as we could have. We must take the positives with us and try to negate the negatives. Hopefully we can come back stronger for the next series." <strong>Steven Smith</strong>: "It was good performance. The boys put the ball in the right areas this afternoon and got the rewards. Everything seemed to happen quickly. Everything seemed to just work out. It's been a good opportunity to expose a few of the players to international cricket. They've shown that they can perform at this level. I thought Xavier, the way he swung the new ball was outstanding. Lance came in today before he hurt himself and bowled nicely. [On Fraser-McGurk] That was exciting wasn't it. Geez he hits them clean when he gets a hold of them. I'm sure we're going to see plenty more of that in the future."

Jake Fraser-McGurk lit up the chase. Josh Inglis was impressive too. They backed up the bowlers work with Xavier Bartlett taking another four-wicket haul. Jake Fraser-McGurk: "It's good to have some self belief to know that I can do it if I ever get picked again. To know that I can do it at the highest level. Personally it's great, and to come away with a 3-0 series win, it's even better. [The coach and captain] thought I showed good intent in Sydney. It was more of a mental thing, not fully committing to that shot. Worked a bit on that and just trying to get my head towards the ball when he bowls that length."

<b>11am</b> Smith and Khawaja walk out to the middle. Smith will be on strike first up. Tim Southee, playing Test No. 99, has the new ball in hand. <b>10.55am</b> The teams are out for their anthems. Siddhartha: "Makes me so sad watching Wagner there, he didn't get a kid's hand to hold..." Asahel: "Is William O'Rourke from England? Would be the reverse Kolpak and is very rare." He was indeed born in the UK. <b>10.48am</b> Thanks Gnasher! Morning, folks. This should be an entertaining affair, and another early test for Steven Smith in his new opening role. Caleb: "If Smith does survive the opening spell, which is a big IF, then the William O'Rourke vs Smith battle will be fascinating, given the success that Tremlett, Morkel, and Finn has had vs Smith." Matt Clere: "Surely they will let Wagner field for a bit? Would be great if he took a screamer." We'll all be rooting for that, I'm sure! If you are tuning in from the USA, you can watch the match live on <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player?id=e775195e-7855-421f-aceb-c947575efdc5">ESPN+</a>. <b>10.45am</b> Not too long to go before the again, so I'll hand over to Abhimanyu who will take you through the first hour. <b>10.35am</b> So it's going to be an early test for Australia's reshuffled top order which is still finding its feet. Steven Smith made 91 not out in his previous innings as opener. Then Cameron Green at No. 4. Trav: "Aside from Mitch Marsh, nobody in the batting department has form. This might be the first summer without a Steve Smith 100 in a long time." Aman: "Is Neil Wagner in the squad?" Only in a ceremonially capacity. Was told he wouldn't be playing. He'll carry the drinks this game as part of his farewell. <b>10.30am</b> <b>New Zealand won the toss and will bowl</b> Tim Southee: "We've played enough here to know it's a good surface, been under covers for the last 24 hours." Confirmation they go with the extra quick Pat Cummins: "We were going to bowl, but not too upset. Some first innings scores have been big." <b>Australia</b> 1 Steven Smith, 2 Usman Khawaja, 3 Marnus Labuschagne, 4 Cameron Green, 5 Travis Head, 6 Mitchell Marsh, 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Pat Cummins (capt), 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Josh Hazlewood <b>New Zealand</b> 1 Tom Latham, 2 Will Young, 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Rachin Ravindra, 5 Daryl Mitchell, 6 Tom Blundell (wk), 7 Glenn Phillips, 8 Scott Kuggeleijn, 9 Matt Henry, 10 Tim Southee (capt), 11 William O'Rourke <b>10.25am</b> There will be excellent crowds for this series - mostly sellouts throughout - which should mean a terrific atmosphere. Hopefully the Wellington weather holds over the next few days. Johan: "Wellington local here. Agreed with BowlingGreggy. This green pitch is deceptive. Looks like a great bowling pitch and might be difficult the first session, but afterwards it turns into a great batting wicket. Seen some big scores here in past years!" Davy: "Wonder if the Blackcaps are making a mistake leaving out a specialist spinner in Santner. The Basin is usually seam friendly, but they need someone to hold down an end if the Aussie batters get going." <b>10.20am</b> And speaking of the latest <i>Around the Wicket</i>, here's the link to the full show with Neroli Meadows, Aaron Finch, Michael Clarke and Ross Taylor. Looking back on the recent T20s, ahead to this Test series and also the latest on India-England <b>10.10am</b> Ross Taylor will be part of ESPN's <i>Around the Wicket</i> over the next couple of weeks during this series and here he <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/ross-taylor-kane-williamson-s-performance-key-for-new-zealand-1422928">discussing New Zealand's prospects</a> and how he sees things playing out. BowlingGreggy: "Morning all, just taken my seat at the ground for the ANZAC derby. The pitch is green, sure, but no more green than normal. Many a visiting captain has won the toss here, sent the opposition in...and then spent the day retrieving the ball from the boundary rope. It drains really well, so moisture won't be an issue, what may be an issue is that they wouldn't have been able to roll it yesterday." Neil: "With Conway out injured and Mitchell available again, I'm picking they'll just reshuffle Young from number 5 up to opener and slot Mitchell back in." Yep, that will be it. <b>10.00am</b> Australia's batting was put under pressure a lot during the recent home summer - finishing, of course, with that Shamar Joseph-inspired collapse at the Gabba - so there's some <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/nz-vs-aus-1st-test-2023-24-inside-knowledge-could-aid-australia-but-batting-concerns-linger-1422918">scrutiny on them in this series</a>. Marnus Labuschagne is one who needs to find some form and Alex <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/marnus-labuschagne-confident-of-finding-form-by-batting-more-and-more-1422819">spoke to him ahead of these matches</a> to find out how he's going about it. <blockquote>I'd have liked some more runs against West Indies. But sometimes it just doesn't happen and I think for me I'm always going to go away and go, okay, how can I improve? What things do I need to get better at and how am I going to do that? What does that look like for me? </blockquote> <b>9.55am</b> There was a little rumble near Wellington this morning with a 4.7 magnitude earthquake on the lower North Island. It appears quite a few people slept through it. Alex was one of those who wasn't woken by the jolt, and here he is to set the scene: "Good morning from Wellington. It is a cool, overcast day. There was some rain this morning but the covers have been off all morning and the roller is going up and down the green-looking pitch. Scott Kuggeleijn has marked out his run-up alongside New Zealand's other three fast bowlers. So the Black Caps are set to play four seamers and leave Mitchell Santner out. Australia are fairly relaxed. An interesting decision looms at the toss. Is anyone brave enough to bat first? Recent history says that is the right decision despite the live green grass on the surface." <b>9.50am</b> We know the Australia XI, Pat Cummins confirmed an unchanged team yesterday, but <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/nz-vs-aus-rain-leaves-new-zealand-waiting-to-decide-on-fourth-bowler-1422915">New Zealand have decision to make</a>. Alex Malcolm reports that Scott Kuggeleijn is marking out his run, so it appears the extra quick is the route they'll take. The pitch remains green, but that's pretty normal. To bring you up to speed with all the pre-match info, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/australia-in-new-zealand-2023-24-1388188/new-zealand-vs-australia-1st-test-1388226/match-preview">here's the preview</a>.

What a competitor he was. <b>9.45am</b> Hello everyone and welcome to our coverage of the opening day of this Trans-Tasman Test series from the Basin Reserve in Wellington. This is a highly-anticipated contest between two strong contenders for the World Test Championship - and the first time Australia have played Tests in New Zealand since 2016. I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Abhimanyu Bose will bring you all the action, while we have Alex Malcolm at the ground and Tristan Lavalette on the report.

<b>11am</b> Smith and Khawaja walk out to the middle. Smith will be on strike first up. Tim Southee, playing Test No. 99, has the new ball in hand. <b>10.55am</b> The teams are out for their anthems. Siddhartha: "Makes me so sad watching Wagner there, he didn't get a kid's hand to hold..." Asahel: "Is William O'Rourke from England? Would be the reverse Kolpak and is very rare." He was indeed born in the UK. <b>10.48am</b> Thanks Gnasher! Morning, folks. This should be an entertaining affair, and another early test for Steven Smith in his new opening role. Caleb: "If Smith does survive the opening spell, which is a big IF, then the William O'Rourke vs Smith battle will be fascinating, given the success that Tremlett, Morkel, and Finn has had vs Smith." Matt Clere: "Surely they will let Wagner field for a bit? Would be great if he took a screamer." We'll all be rooting for that, I'm sure! If you are tuning in from the USA, you can watch the match live on <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player?id=e775195e-7855-421f-aceb-c947575efdc5">ESPN+</a>. <b>10.45am</b> Not too long to go before the again, so I'll hand over to Abhimanyu who will take you through the first hour. <b>10.35am</b> So it's going to be an early test for Australia's reshuffled top order which is still finding its feet. Steven Smith made 91 not out in his previous innings as opener. Then Cameron Green at No. 4. Trav: "Aside from Mitch Marsh, nobody in the batting department has form. This might be the first summer without a Steve Smith 100 in a long time." Aman: "Is Neil Wagner in the squad?" Only in a ceremonially capacity. Was told he wouldn't be playing. He'll carry the drinks this game as part of his farewell. <b>10.30am</b> <b>New Zealand won the toss and will bowl</b> Tim Southee: "We've played enough here to know it's a good surface, been under covers for the last 24 hours." Confirmation they go with the extra quick Pat Cummins: "We were going to bowl, but not too upset. Some first innings scores have been big." <b>Australia</b> 1 Steven Smith, 2 Usman Khawaja, 3 Marnus Labuschagne, 4 Cameron Green, 5 Travis Head, 6 Mitchell Marsh, 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Pat Cummins (capt), 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Josh Hazlewood <b>New Zealand</b> 1 Tom Latham, 2 Will Young, 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Rachin Ravindra, 5 Daryl Mitchell, 6 Tom Blundell (wk), 7 Glenn Phillips, 8 Scott Kuggeleijn, 9 Matt Henry, 10 Tim Southee (capt), 11 William O'Rourke <b>10.25am</b> There will be excellent crowds for this series - mostly sellouts throughout - which should mean a terrific atmosphere. Hopefully the Wellington weather holds over the next few days. Johan: "Wellington local here. Agreed with BowlingGreggy. This green pitch is deceptive. Looks like a great bowling pitch and might be difficult the first session, but afterwards it turns into a great batting wicket. Seen some big scores here in past years!" Davy: "Wonder if the Blackcaps are making a mistake leaving out a specialist spinner in Santner. The Basin is usually seam friendly, but they need someone to hold down an end if the Aussie batters get going." <b>10.20am</b> And speaking of the latest <i>Around the Wicket</i>, here's the link to the full show with Neroli Meadows, Aaron Finch, Michael Clarke and Ross Taylor. Looking back on the recent T20s, ahead to this Test series and also the latest on India-England <b>10.10am</b> Ross Taylor will be part of ESPN's <i>Around the Wicket</i> over the next couple of weeks during this series and here he <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/ross-taylor-kane-williamson-s-performance-key-for-new-zealand-1422928">discussing New Zealand's prospects</a> and how he sees things playing out. BowlingGreggy: "Morning all, just taken my seat at the ground for the ANZAC derby. The pitch is green, sure, but no more green than normal. Many a visiting captain has won the toss here, sent the opposition in...and then spent the day retrieving the ball from the boundary rope. It drains really well, so moisture won't be an issue, what may be an issue is that they wouldn't have been able to roll it yesterday." Neil: "With Conway out injured and Mitchell available again, I'm picking they'll just reshuffle Young from number 5 up to opener and slot Mitchell back in." Yep, that will be it. <b>10.00am</b> Australia's batting was put under pressure a lot during the recent home summer - finishing, of course, with that Shamar Joseph-inspired collapse at the Gabba - so there's some <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/nz-vs-aus-1st-test-2023-24-inside-knowledge-could-aid-australia-but-batting-concerns-linger-1422918">scrutiny on them in this series</a>. Marnus Labuschagne is one who needs to find some form and Alex <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/marnus-labuschagne-confident-of-finding-form-by-batting-more-and-more-1422819">spoke to him ahead of these matches</a> to find out how he's going about it. <blockquote>I'd have liked some more runs against West Indies. But sometimes it just doesn't happen and I think for me I'm always going to go away and go, okay, how can I improve? What things do I need to get better at and how am I going to do that? What does that look like for me? </blockquote> <b>9.55am</b> There was a little rumble near Wellington this morning with a 4.7 magnitude earthquake on the lower North Island. It appears quite a few people slept through it. Alex was one of those who wasn't woken by the jolt, and here he is to set the scene: "Good morning from Wellington. It is a cool, overcast day. There was some rain this morning but the covers have been off all morning and the roller is going up and down the green-looking pitch. Scott Kuggeleijn has marked out his run-up alongside New Zealand's other three fast bowlers. So the Black Caps are set to play four seamers and leave Mitchell Santner out. Australia are fairly relaxed. An interesting decision looms at the toss. Is anyone brave enough to bat first? Recent history says that is the right decision despite the live green grass on the surface." <b>9.50am</b> We know the Australia XI, Pat Cummins confirmed an unchanged team yesterday, but <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/nz-vs-aus-rain-leaves-new-zealand-waiting-to-decide-on-fourth-bowler-1422915">New Zealand have decision to make</a>. Alex Malcolm reports that Scott Kuggeleijn is marking out his run, so it appears the extra quick is the route they'll take. The pitch remains green, but that's pretty normal. To bring you up to speed with all the pre-match info, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/australia-in-new-zealand-2023-24-1388188/new-zealand-vs-australia-1st-test-1388226/match-preview">here's the preview</a>. The big news for New Zealand, of course, has been a player who won't be on the field with the non-selection and then <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/new-zealand-news-neil-wagner-retires-from-international-cricket-1422785">retirement of Neil Wagner</a>. What a competitor he was. <b>9.45am</b> Hello everyone and welcome to our coverage of the opening day of this Trans-Tasman Test series from the Basin Reserve in Wellington. This is a highly-anticipated contest between two strong contenders for the World Test Championship - and the first time Australia have played Tests in New Zealand since 2016. I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Abhimanyu Bose will bring you all the action, while we have Alex Malcolm at the ground and Tristan Lavalette on the report.

And that will be <b>drinks</b>. Khawaja vs Henry was a great battle, with the batter showing great patience as Henry probed and probed. Smith, after getting squared up a couple of times, has looked disciplined. There hasn't been a lot of run-scoring, but Australia will be happy to have gone through the hour without losing a wicket. New Zealand won't be too disappointed either with how they have bowled, though. And here's Gnasher to take you through to lunch.

Fetches the wide half-volley, creams through cover. Okay, it's full, not a half-volley, Smith is outside off and yet has to reach out with a semi-horizontal bat. But he plays those drives more assuredly than most others

Mohd Irshad : "Is it last game for Smith before they move on to find another opener and get him back at 4?" No, Australia's next Test is at home in India at the end of the year. Smith should be in unless there are fitness or unforeseen issues

Steven Smith lbw b Sears 11 (24b 2x4 0x6 34m) SR: 45.83
<strong>Smith shoulders arms, gets hit on the pad and Nitin Menon gives him out lbw</strong>. Smith was perplexed and reviewed after a chat with Khawaja. Was a length ball that came back in, wedged on the inner-half of the front pad as he got square-on. He had shuffled outside off but that isn't enough. Impact doesn't matter and the ball was just clipping off, Smith looks up in frustration and trudges back. Cheers among the NZ players as Sears takes his maiden Test wicket.
