Was a length ball that came back in, wedged on the inner-half of the front pad as he got square-on. He had shuffled outside off but that isn't enough. Impact doesn't matter and the ball was just clipping off, Smith looks up in frustration and trudges back. Cheers among the NZ players as Sears takes his maiden Test wicket."}]<strong>Smith shoulders arms, gets hit on the pad and Nitin Menon gives him out lbw</strong>.
