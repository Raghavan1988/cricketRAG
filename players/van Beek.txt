well taken by Nortje! He was placed at cover-point, and moved to his left while looking up at the sky. The ball dropped, and into his hands as he took them while tumbling to the ground. It was another slower ball from Baartman, who bowled on a fullish length and into leg. Van Beek made room and went for the loft, but was beaten by the change of pace again. In the end, his attempted loft went only as far as halfway towards deep point
<strong>Anrich Nortje</strong>: "Jansen has been bowling well in both games. Unfortunately a wicket off a no-ball... The boys did really well. The two games we've had, we've been really good in fielding. That's been one of our strengths. It's great to be back. It's very fun to be part of [this side]. Everyone knows everyone. We really hope we go all the way." <strong>12pm</strong> Netherlands huff and puff to just about a hundred. Engelbrecht scored 40 out of 103, adding 54 along with van Beek after Netherlands were 48 for 6 at one stage. But credit to Baartman, Nortje and co for using changes of pace effectively, and executing the lines and lengths on a pitch where there continued to be extra bounce. There's not much to chase for South Africa, but who really knows? Join Ekanth for the start of the chase in ten.

another boundary, and another teaser for a South Africa fielder! These two target Rabada, whose slower balls are being read well. He bowled at a change of pace on a length around off, as van Beek chipped it late to just beat mid-on to his left

van Beek is OUT! caught

well taken by Nortje! He was placed at cover-point, and moved to his left while looking up at the sky. The ball dropped, and into his hands as he took them while tumbling to the ground. It was another slower ball from Baartman, who bowled on a fullish length and into leg. Van Beek made room and went for the loft, but was beaten by the change of pace again. In the end, his attempted loft went only as far as halfway towards deep point
<strong>Anrich Nortje</strong>: "Jansen has been bowling well in both games. Unfortunately a wicket off a no-ball... The boys did really well. The two games we've had, we've been really good in fielding. That's been one of our strengths. It's great to be back. It's very fun to be part of [this side]. Everyone knows everyone. We really hope we go all the way." <strong>12pm</strong> Netherlands huff and puff to just about a hundred. Engelbrecht scored 40 out of 103, adding 54 along with van Beek after Netherlands were 48 for 6 at one stage. But credit to Baartman, Nortje and co for using changes of pace effectively, and executing the lines and lengths on a pitch where there continued to be extra bounce. There's not much to chase for South Africa, but who really knows? Join Ekanth for the start of the chase in ten. And in the meanwhile, don't miss out on the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-the-nassau-county-international-cricket-stadiums-drop-in-pitches-explainer-1437535">explainer by Nagraj Gollapudi</a>: what's wrong with the T20 World Cup pitches in New York?

ohh, change of pace, and van Beek is fooled. He backed away early, and this fullish ball angled in to go past leg stump as he looked to push

is that another one? I think it is! A run out or stumping? This is a googly tuning in to off stump, that van Beek tries to paddle around the corner. Gets an under edge to it though, and wickekeeper Kusal Mendis gets a pad to it, and as van Beek takes off for a single, and then turns back, has time to run the batter out. Great work from KM.
