Fullish length on the pads, clipped to midwicket. <strong>Ngarava looks to be in pain</strong>, not sure what happened exactly. He's clutching just above the right knee. Okay, the replay is in after the ad break. The fielder threw it at the non-striker's end and Ngarava was backing up at mid-on. He got on one knee and tried to stop the ball low but looked to have twitched something. All okay at the end, he's good to stay on
Drinks will be taken as Ngarava gets medical attention

Ishanka : "@Naveen Looks like you don't like Kusal! Wanidu indeed is a great T20 player. But yet he has to prove in ODIs. There is a reason why he was dropped from RCB and picked in IPL for lower rate than expected. Because his recent form was not par. He is yet to show his potential as an all rounder. Yes - Kusal failed as a batter in the World Cup, but from what I saw he did well as a captain. I wouldn't come to any judgements soon without giving him some time. "

ufff, another very late guiding of the ball towards short third. That looked really dangerous to be playing so belatedly, with the ball being on a length on off.

This was a pick up shot off a fullish delivery, but doesn't get the distance. Omarzai juggles and drops though.

top edge, caught excellently by Mustafizur at short fine. This is a shortish ball that takes off a bit, and Asalanka tries to play one of his powerful cross-bat shots, but is surprised by the bounce and can offer only a high catch. Fizz does well to track it through the air and get under it
