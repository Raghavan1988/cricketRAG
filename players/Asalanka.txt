Nearly a run out! Good length outside off, goes back and punches this towards point. They think about scurrying a tight single, but Asalanka is turned back and needs a dive here to see him home. Direct hit would've seen him gone. Brilliant work in the field as well

<B>Flicked and straight to the man in the deep!</b> Just like Kamindu earlier, Asalanka whips this off the pads. Catches it cleanly but it's right down Hendrick's throat at deep square leg. Sri Lanka are down for the count
