finishes with a dipping full toss, Atkinson slugs through midwicket - and then askes the question about the no-ball. But the umpires are happy and that will be that for the England innings
<b>7.20pm:</b> So England scrap and scrape their way up to... something. To be fair, they were right in the muck at 49 for 5, following a three-wicket salvo from debutant Matthew Forde, only for Ben Duckett to drag them out of trouble. In the end, it needed the last-wicket pair to get them above 200, but we will wait and see what Duckworth-Lewis-Stern has to say about the target after that break for rain at 33 overs. Before we get going again, here's a word from Forde: "Playing for West Indies is a dream, playing in front of my home crowd was special. [Target] I'm backing my players to chase them down. [Pitch] Bit of seam movement and bounce up front but hopefully it will play okay now." Miller will be here for the resumption in a bit
