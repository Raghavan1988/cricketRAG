loud appeal for lbw, but there seemed to be an inside edge and it's not given. Balbirnie isn't too interested in a review either. Nope, no inside edge, but he was hit on his back leg, with the ball probably sliding down off a length after being angled in

Zia-ur-Rehman is OUT! caught

Zia-ur-Rehman c Balbirnie b Adair 6 (15b 1x4 0x6 22m) SR: 40
<strong>now taken by second slip!</strong> This is pretty simple, and Zia's stay of hit-and-miss ends. Adair went on the fuller side of a length on off, angling it into the right-hander. But the ball moved away after pitching, and Zia went driving at it with an angled bat outside off. He got an outside edge, and Balbirnie gobbled it up

<strong>uff, nearly taken by third slip!</strong> It would have been terrific catch by McBrine had he nabbed it. He leaped with his right hand up, and replays show the ball just tickled his fingers as Zia got an outside edge off this length ball on sixth stump while he looked to push
