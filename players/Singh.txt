Keeper shows good presence of mind and pings a throw to Evans who dislodges the bails at the non-striker's end and Jones is not even in the picture. USA in dire straits!"}]Pulls his length back, nips this past the outside edge, gets some lateral movement and good bounce. That's a terrible botch up in the middle, last thing USA needed was a run-out. Keeper shows good presence of mind and pings a throw to Evans who dislodges the bails at the non-striker's end and Jones is not even in the picture. USA in dire straits!
