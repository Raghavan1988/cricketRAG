<strong>Clobbered!</strong> Round the wicket on a shortish length, angling into the pads, just a half flick of a wrist and it goes all the way into the stands over square leg. Beautiful sound of the bat!

Right on the money. Pulls his length back, it gets good bounce as he fends it to the leg side, wayward throw at the non-striker's end leaks extra runs

Comes back strongly with an effort delivery pitched on a shorter length and floating outside off, gets a bit late in defending, inside edge off the bat and it dies down close to the off stump

Horrible mix-up once again as he steers this down to point and was not looking at the non-striker who was already halfway down the pitch and didn't stop.

Pulls his length back, nips this past the outside edge, gets some lateral movement and good bounce. That's a terrible botch up in the middle, last thing USA needed was a run-out. Keeper shows good presence of mind and pings a throw to Evans who dislodges the bails at the non-striker's end and Jones is not even in the picture. USA in dire straits!
