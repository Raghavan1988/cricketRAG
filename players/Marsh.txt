Hope you enjoyed it just as much as we loved bringing it to you. There is more T20 World Cup action lined up, with co-hosts USA taking on India in about eleven and a half hours from now. Do join us for that game too, but until then, this is goodbye from me (Shashwat), Ranjith, Vairavan and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care, folks! <b>Mitchell Marsh, Australia captain:</b> I thought it was a great performance from our bowling team. It was a beautiful wicket, a bit of swing out there. A professional performance. Great to qualify for the Super Eight. We get really busy after the game against Scotland and we will try to manage (our workloads). Hopefully we can win that and then move into the Super Eight. (On Zampa) If you look at his career, over the past four or five years, he is probably our most important player, in our structure. He loves the big moment, the pressure and he is bowling beautifully at the moment. (How they are keeping themselves prepared) Probably having not as many beers as you had back in the day Haydos (laughs). We have our families here, and with the wind around, it is perfect (smiles). <b>Gerhard Erasmus, Namibia captain:</b> (On what they learnt from tonight) That you cannot sit back against the best in the world - that is one thing we learnt tonight. The skill gap is there but you can sort of close that by fighting fire with fire. We did not do that tonight. A good side like Australia will expose you if you are not willing to mentally step up on this level on a particular day. The conditions were fair throughout the last two games and we could not play well enough according to those conditions. Sampath tells me this is the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/trophy/team-largest-margins/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-89">second biggest victory in men's T20 World Cup history (by balls remaining)</a>, only behind Sri Lanka's nine-wicket win against the Netherlands in the 2014 edition. <b>Adam Zampa, Player of the Match:</b> To get the win tonight and qualify for the Super Eights, that is a nice feeling. (On if he feels the ball is coming out well) Yes and no. I bowled a couple of pies tonight but in general, the ball feels like it is coming out well. Being encouraged to pick up wickets in the middle, particularly by the captain. (Challenge of bowling with the breeze) We experienced that in Barbados as well. We know on these wickets that is a challenge. We are happy, it is the first step in trying to take the trophy home but a long way to go (still). <strong>10:40pm</strong> Well, that ended fairly quickly, didn't it? It took Australia all of 34 balls to hunt down Namibia's score and they now become the second team alongside South Africa to officially qualify for the next stage. Warner blazed away while he was at the crease, with Head doing so once Warner was dismissed. Marsh also struck a couple of boundaries towards the end and this batting display was just as ruthless as their bowling performance. Nothing much to really report from a Namibian POV. They simply did not have enough runs on the board and were blasted out of the water completely in the second innings. Not an evening they will look back upon fondly but they are not the first team to be at the hands of such a pasting from Australia, and they might not be the last either.
