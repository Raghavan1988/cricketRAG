scythed away into the gap at deep point. But that's <b> absolute hara-kiri from the batters. </b> Total breakdown in communication. White wanted to come back for the second to keep Delany on strike for the next over, but the throw from the deep was right on the bounce to Pant, who whipped the bails off. White took off for the second and just stopped. As it turns out, even if he'd hared instantly on the turn, chances of making it back were remote.
Andy Flower and Sanjay Manjrekar will dissect that innings for you. On the other side of the break, everybody's favourite, Alan Gardner, will be fit and firing to bring you the chase. If you're an Irish fan, look away. Sure, the pitch wasn't easy to bat on but they didn't help their cause with some of the shot selection. Arshdeep was superb in his first spell, a fully fit and firing Hardik had an excellent day out with the ball while Siraj and Bumrah were super steady. India ticked every single box they would've hoped to on the field. Onto the batting now. Wonder if they'll look to score quickly to try and give their NRR an early leg up. "Always special to play for the country, WC is something I've been able to contribute," Hardik says after his 3/27. "I really liked the first wicket. Generally don't hit the stumps often, I have a tendency to bowl back of a length, but on this wicket I needed to be a lot fuller to be in the game. Yes if you bowl short, the ball may fly. It's always fantastic to see crowd supporting us, we Indians are everywhere, we rule the world. Good to have so much support, many thanks to them." Meanwhile, we're also building up to an emotional farewell game of one of India's sporting icons. Sunil Chhetri's 94 goals for India put him alongside Ronaldo and Messi, but India's greatest-ever footballer has many more incredible numbers. With his national team career ending tomorrow, here are the best statistics from <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/story/_/id/40282192/sunil-chhetri-career-stats-goals-appearances-ronaldo-messi-indian-football" target="_blank">a record-breaking 19 years</a>.

Rashid lifts the series trophy, as Afghanistan come from behind to win the T20I series 2-1. That was it from us for this tour, with Ireland taking the one-off Test, and Afghanistan winning both limited-overs series. Until next time, this is goodnight and goodbye from Vairavan and me, Himanshu! Take care! <strong>Rashid Khan is the Player of the Series</strong>: "So happy to be on the winning side. It was tough for me to come back after three-four months. A great series win, especially for the youngsters. They delivered. Even the senior players stood up and performed. Cricket is all about enjoyment; that's why you have to give the free hand to the youngsters. The future of Afghanistan cricket is very bright. We planned about the World Cup since I became the captain. We have in mind that we have to perform at the World Cup. We need to be well prepared, mentally and physically both." <strong>Paul Stirling</strong>, Ireland captain: "We were slightly off the pace, and beaten by the better side. But really proud of some performances. It's hard to bowl to any batsman here in the back end. You've got to pick your players and back them; That's what we're going to do. That Test match [win] was special. We look forward to the next series." <strong>Ibrahim Zadran is the Player of the Match</strong>: "I am really happy with my performance today. I didn't play well in the first two games. From my side especially, I wanted to play well today. It's quite tough to play all three formats, but I try to adjust with each format as quickly as I can. I try to enjoy and adjust quickly. We don't have any series before the [T20] World Cup, so we'll see where we can improve. But I will work hard for the World Cup. Everyone will try to have a good World Cup." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> <strong>Naveen-ul-Haq</strong>: "Coming into the series, I was feeling well. But the first game didn't go my way; it happens. It was a good game [today]. Early breakthroughs were needed. I have been playing quite a lot of T20 cricket. So it is good preparation for me heading into the T20 World Cup. The second wicket I liked the most, because we - me, Nabi and Rashid - had planned it that way." <strong>11.27pm</strong> The chase was never on. Never did it feel that Ireland were on track on hunt down 156. They were 15 for 3 in the third over, and Afghanistan ensured there was no way back for Ireland from there. There was a brief recovery during the fourth-wicket stand, but it was nipped at 24; there was hope even during the sixth-wicket pair's counter, but it was broken soon after. Omarzai got 4 for 9, and Naveen bagged 3 for 10, as Afghanistan won comfortably. Hang around for the presentations.
