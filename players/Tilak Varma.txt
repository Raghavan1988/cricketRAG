See you soon! <B>2.23pm</b> Time for the presentation.<BR><BR><B>Losing captain Markram:</b> Tough one. We would've liked to put on a really good score batting first. Credit to their bowling attack with the lateral movement. We weren't even to settle and build partnership.  Problem right from the start and couldn't pull things back. (Misread the pitch?) We expected it to go around a little bit. Generally in the day games it does do something for 5-7 overs, we've seen that before. But today it went along for longer and we couldn't get in and build partnerships. (Aggressive batting - was that the general way out in tough conditions?) Strange one. I think it comes down to individuals. When you are out there you have to assess yourself and communicate with the partner. We encourage guys to be positive but also choose smart options. We'll have to assess. (Would you bat first again?) Probably not [laughs]."<BR><BR><B>Player of the Match Arshdeep Singh:</b> "Feel little sore but loving the movement. I learnt about the altitude only after a few overs when I was running out of breath. Had to build on from there. (Last year to here) Personally it feels good because when you play you have a dream to play for the country. I am enjoying my role and want to thank Rahul <i>bhai</I> as well. He said I should come back strongly and aim for a five-for.  (how does this set you up for the next 2 games?) Its about enjoying the game. When we go to Gqeberha, we need to know what will work there and look for a good result there too."<BR><BR><B>Winning captain Rahul:</b> "Lost three ODIs as captain here last time around. Good to get a win here in SA today. The plans were to bring the spinners into the game, but there was lot of help in the wicket early and the boys [pacers] bowled really well. (Chopping and changing players in the XI, esp the bowling attack) Its just how cricket is being played in the last couple of years. You have to rest some players, you prioritise one format every now and then. Now it is T20s and Tests. But we want to take guys who are doing their best. Everyone's doing well in first class and IPL too, so good for them to get a taste too."

India win with 33.2 overs to spare, courtesy the two half-centuries from Sudharsan and Iyer in the small chase. But most of the credit for this win goes to Arshdeep Singh (5-37) with his swinging deliveries with the new ball, Avesh Khan's (4-27) appetite to bend his back, and the strong return spells from both the bowlers. India take a 1-0 lead and because of the lack of runs today, it's also a shame that the game, in itself, couldn't raise a lot of funds for Breast Cancer Awareness either. In all, the game lasted about 44 overs and we'll be having the presentation shortly. rajith: "its amazing to see the maturity and composure shown by some of the young players recently came to indian team," fabian: "Sai Sudharshan.

<strong>picks out deep square leg!</strong> End of a magnificent partnership that was reaching dangerous proportions for South Africa. Selfless from Tilak, was looking to accelerate. Fetched this slog sweep from outside off, struck it well but picked out the lone man there. Played. Struggled early on but made up for it later on.
