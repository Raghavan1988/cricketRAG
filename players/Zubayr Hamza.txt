Here's Shaun chirping "I see Neil Brand doesnt think his side is too far off the pace. Maybe Neil if you could actually bat for more than an hour you'd be right." I did share the pessimism a while ago but the batters haven't really looked out of place today tbh

Nice use of the crease from Southee but Hamza's front-foot game is upto the mark. Ball was full and wide, he did reach out away from the body but middled the check-punch through cover
Liam: "Hamza has to up his rate here, even if it is just rotating the strike. The ball is now coming up to 40 overs old, so SA need to start putting some pressure back on NZ" Agree with the comms on air, who said after the last over that the batters have to take on Ravindra. They can't let him ease into his spell at least
