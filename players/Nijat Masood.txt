Campher needs just two balls to nick off Njat. Pitched right up, angled in and Nijat played for it to come straight. The ball, however, swung away and left the batter opened up. He tried to block straight, got an edge. Keeper takes a low catch. Pacers now have all nine wickets!

More enterprising defence as Masood gets funky with a block to cover
