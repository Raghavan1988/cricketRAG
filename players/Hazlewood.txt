Mustafa Moudi: "Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and now Sean Abbot - Aussie Pacers are handy batsmen too. Add to that the likes Maxwell, Stoinis and Green who can bowl too.... This is the reason why Australia is the World Champions currently - Contributions keeps coming from everywhere and not just from the ones specialized for it !!"

Hazlewood is OUT! caught
c Clarkson b Ferguson
Josh Hazlewood c Clarkson b Ferguson 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0
<strong>Caught by Clarkson at deep point</strong>. Very full and very wide of off - not quite a yorker - Hazlewood reaches out for the ball and slices it to Clarkson who gives the thumbs-up to his team-mates
<b>8.50pm</b> Australia rushed to 74 for 1 in the powerplay, but a collapse, triggered by Sears and Ferguson, set them back. That they eventually got to 174 was down to Cummins' cameo. Ferguson came away with 4 for 12; he was also terrific in the opening T20I. "Look obviously, they got off to a flyer and I thought Sears was exceptional tonight," Ferguson says. "Really enjoying being back with the group and nice to close it out. 174 is a decent total to change. This is one of the best crowds I've played in front of." Alex will be back with you for the start of NZ's chase. Cheers<hr>
