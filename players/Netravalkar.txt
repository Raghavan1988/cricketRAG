Ashwin: "Any score above 220 is a job well done for USA considering they were 18/4 and scored 70 odd runs in 25 overs for the fall of 5 wickets. Nepal's frequent and chronic loss of traction in the death overs is appalling. This is the reason it lost its first match and could have serious impact on today's match as well."

<b>12.42 pm</b> USA scrapes their way to 211 for 8. But again this looks like an extremely underwhelming total on pitches in Harare and Takashinga which have flattened out significantly in the afternoon sun paired with short boundaries. USA makes just 39 runs off the last eight overs, a sequence which started with four wickets in hand, striking just two fours across that entire stretch. For context, Scotland scored 56 off the final five overs yesterday - including seven fours and two sixes in the last five overs - in the one-wicket win over Ireland despite being eight wickets down when that sequence began. Netherlands will be heavy favorites to chase this total down. The only saving grace for USA is that they have a very fresh Ali Khan in their bowling unit today for the first time all tournament. Can he inspire USA to victory in the field to keep their Super Sixes hopes alive? Or will the Dutch keep USA winless and bring up their first win in the process? Stay with us for the start of the chase coming p shortly when Shashwat Kumar will be back in the central commentary position.
