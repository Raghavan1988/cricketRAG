<strong>Gone</strong>! Springs down the track and miscues it straight to Glenn Phillips at point, insolently gives him a charge and has gone without troubling the scorers on his international debut. Despondently takes the long walk back to the pavilion, was trying a big heave over the leg side and got ruffled by the bounce and the inward movement off the pitch, a rash shot to start the proceedings, could have taken some time to get used to the conditions

Grab your snacks, settle down, and get ready for what promises to be an entertaining contest on a beautiful Sunday morning in Christchurch. Just a few minutes away from the action. Faraz: "Main thing that splits the sides is the spin attack. Santner and Sodhi can apply the shackles in the middle overs for NZ whereas Pakistan have nobody to do that job anymore" MominS: "Iftikhar doing nothing with bat and not bowling part time should definitely have been omitted and Usama Mir as well. Its cruel to not give another chance to Azam Khan, Saim and Amer Jamal. Poor captaincy and management decisions Tanveer : "What the is going on persisting with Iftikhar is not the way to go could have been Azam Khan to just give him last chance in a dead rubber." Waqar: "The management should have given Saim Ayub a proper chance when you took him into the team. Why didn't they play him in the 5th T20 match? Aufan Rashid : "All domestic performer being openers are the only reason behind selecting 5 openers!!! You cant play 5 openers instead of specialist middle orders!!

There are good signs from everyone so far. You want your whole squad to be performing at different times and that's what is happening <strong>Shaheen Afridi:</strong> It's the same wicket we played on the last game and I feel it will turn Haris Rauf, Saim Ayub, Mohammad Wasim Jnr have been rested for the fifth T20I and in come Haseebullah Khan, Abbas Afridi and Usama Mir Wicket-keeper batter Haseebullah Khan hails from Pishin, Baluchistan and had an impressive outing in the Under-19 World Cup in 2022. He played for Peshawar Zalmi in the Pakistan Super League season 8 "Daryl's a three-format player, so it's really important that we do manage his workload over this period. He's highly likely to play a big part in the rest of our [home] season. So we just thought this is an opportune time [to give him a break], given the series is won," <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/daryl-mitchell-rested-for-fifth-t20i-against-pakistan-rachin-ravindra-called-up-1417374">said New Zealand coach Gary Stead </a> Davy: "I hope Mark Chapman gets promoted today. He's hardly had a bat, and deserves a chance to shine at home!" Noman Ali : "Poor saim became victim of his own aggressive approach." Aby Mathew: "If pak wants to defend a total . They ought to get a 200  score against this big hitting kiwi batting else it's gonna be a first ever whitewash for Pakistan." Shaheer Mansoor: "They could have gone for Azam instead of Iftikhar in my opinion for this final go, I still believe he'll be the best player to go with for wc considering the wc is in Caribbean." Numan: "It's midnight at Stockholm, waiting for toss and wishing Pakistan to avoid white wash. " Ali: "Fakhar Zaman should open for Pakistan. You want your best opener to play as many balls in power play as possible." <strong>12.10pm: </strong>Pakistan created some panic in the fourth T20I after Shaheen Afridi picked wickets upfront while defending a little subpar 159 but New Zealand slowly crawled their way back into the game with a wonderful partnership between Glenn Phillips and Daryl Mitchell that got them comfortably over the line.

It will be more match practice for New Zealand and a matter of salvaging some pride after facing a 4-0 drubbing for Pakistan, as the visitors look down and out and need some positives to carry before traveling back home. It's another game at Hagley Oval Park in the central city of Christchurch, and once again, fans have thronged to the ground in large numbers. I am Rvel Zahid and will bring you the action. The match will get underway at 1 pm local time Pakistan appears to be lacking the killer instinct and fearless brand of cricket traditionally associated with them. The management staff could have done a better job of alleviating pressure on the youngsters and granting them the freedom to play in their natural ways. Pakistan's experienced pace duo of Haris Rauf and Shaheen Afridi hasn't been consistent and at the peak of their powers since the ODI World Cup in India last year, affecting Pakistan in both powerplays and death overs. On the other hand, New Zealand will be pleased with their perfect 4-0 scoreline and will look to cap off a flawless start to World Cup preparations with a 5-0 win. Finn Allen has sent an early warning to all teams ahead of the marquee event in the United States and the Caribbean. There is no forecast for rain, and we should expect a full game in this brilliant sunshine and beautiful ground. Daryl Mitchell, a consistent performer in the middle order, has been rested for this game as part of the workload management plan.
