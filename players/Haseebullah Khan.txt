You want your best opener to play as many balls in power play as possible." <strong>12.10pm: </strong>Pakistan created some panic in the fourth T20I after Shaheen Afridi picked wickets upfront while defending a little subpar 159 but New Zealand slowly crawled their way back into the game with a wonderful partnership between Glenn Phillips and Daryl Mitchell that got them comfortably over the line. Here's how things panned out in the last game <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/pakistan-in-new-zealand-2023-24-1388184/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-4th-t20i-1388219/match-report">Fast bowlers, Phillips, Mitchell flatten Pakistan for 4-0</a> <strong>12pm: </strong> Hello everyone and welcome to the coverage of the final T20I of the series. It will be more match practice for New Zealand and a matter of salvaging some pride after facing a 4-0 drubbing for Pakistan, as the visitors look down and out and need some positives to carry before traveling back home. It's another game at Hagley Oval Park in the central city of Christchurch, and once again, fans have thronged to the ground in large numbers. I am Rvel Zahid and will bring you the action. The match will get underway at 1 pm local time Pakistan appears to be lacking the killer instinct and fearless brand of cricket traditionally associated with them. The management staff could have done a better job of alleviating pressure on the youngsters and granting them the freedom to play in their natural ways. Pakistan's experienced pace duo of Haris Rauf and Shaheen Afridi hasn't been consistent and at the peak of their powers since the ODI World Cup in India last year, affecting Pakistan in both powerplays and death overs. On the other hand, New Zealand will be pleased with their perfect 4-0 scoreline and will look to cap off a flawless start to World Cup preparations with a 5-0 win. Finn Allen has sent an early warning to all teams ahead of the marquee event in the United States and the Caribbean. There is no forecast for rain, and we should expect a full game in this brilliant sunshine and beautiful ground. Daryl Mitchell, a consistent performer in the middle order, has been rested for this game as part of the workload management plan.
