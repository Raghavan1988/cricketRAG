Kuldeep has the five-for on his birthday. Miller knows there is no point batting this innings out. He tries to hit out, shuffles across for the big sweep, and Kuldeep fires this in full and straight to hit the leg stump
<b>8.35pm</b> That brings us to an end for tonight. Entertaining short little series. Shame about the rain in the first match or we might have had a result. Now the captains share the spoils, and move on to the ODIs starting Sunday, which will be the Pink Day. Join us then, and thanks for tuning in tonight. Stay hydrated, and don't take mid-match assessments too seriously. <b>8.30pm Suryakumar Yadav, the winning captain, is also the Player of the match</b>. He is hobbling around after his injury. He is also the Player of the Series. He says, and this is not verbatim: "I am good. I am able to walk so it is not that serious. It was wonderful scoring a hundred, and especially when it comes in a winning cause. One box we wanted to tick was play fearless brand of cricket. Really happy the boys showed a lot of character. Kuldeep is never happy with a three-for or a four-for. A perfect self birthday present." "At mid innings break, a statement was indeed made: at this stage, I dare say that this might not be par!" Kaushik, it says "might". And it never says "below par" <b>8.27pm</b> <b>Aiden Markram</B> says, and this is not verbatim: "To be honest, I wasn't toon unhappy with the 200 looking at how the pitch played as I watched it when fielding. It felt like a little stoppy and a little down when we were batting, while when we were fielding it looked like they could hit it anywhere." <b>8.17pm</b> Big win to level the series after the first one was washed out and the second lost to South Africa. It looked like a par total for Johannesburg, but India managed to find movement of all three kinds: Siraj swung it in the air, the ball nipped when bowled on wobble seam, and then it turned and gripped and bounced indifferently when the spinners came on. The bowlers were too good to waste those conditions. Siraj playing around with Hendricks at the top of the innings will be a memorable spell of play in T20 cricket. In the first innings of the match, Suryakumar Yadav recovered from a slow start to score a fourth T20I century full of the usual scarcely believable shots. He rolled over his ankle when fielding, and Jadeja led the team for the majority of the defence. Not only did all the bowling changes and field placements work, Jadeja himself took the big wicket of Markram and had figures of 3-0-25-2 to go with the five-for for Kuldeep. Debs: "Kuldeep's last 6 balls read 1-0-1-4. Amazing" Karthik Iyappan: "South Africa lost to SURYAKUMAR YADAV(100runs today) by 5 runs!!! "@Sid - you are saying it looked like a par total.

And with that it's a wrap from us. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/south-africa-vs-sri-lanka-4th-match-group-d-1415704/points-table-standings">Here's</a> how the table looks for Group D after this result. Sri Lanka might have been expecting a net run rate pounding after being bowled out for 77, but in the end it's definitely recoverable. But now they have no more margin for error going forward. Their next game will be up against Bangladesh on Saturday, but more immediately we have Afghanistan taking on Uganda in another six hours or so, while tomorrow will also see England taking on Scotland in the late game. Be sure to join us for that, but until then, on behalf of Fidel and the rest of the team this is Madushka signing out! <B>Aiden Markram</b>: "Yeah happy with the win. The batting was a little up and down, speaks to quite a tough wicket but we found some way to score runs. It's a tough one from a batting perspective. You try to take the pitch out of it, but if the ball misbehaves or there's low bounce, it's just one of those things and hopefully we can take some learnings out of it. [importance of adapting] Lots of different conditions as you move around the tournament. Obviously fortunate that we have our next two games here, so we know what to expect. But important to assess as you move around. [Nortje] Wasn't worried about him, but it's a fantastic day for him. From a mental point of view, he was massively down [with his recent form], so the boys were really happy for him. And hopefully he kicks on for the rest of the tournament. <B>Wanindu Hasaranga</b>: [right decision to bat first?] Yeah, our batters were looking at 160-170. To be honest this a 120 wicket, especially with our bowlers. [How did you find the pitch?] We went with our bowling strength, that's why we batted first. We wanted to put up a good score and defend it. [Positives] This is early in the tournament, as a team we wanted to do much better especially in the batting. We know we have bowling strength, so if our batters do well we can go further." Karthik: "Could this game have the most dot balls in a Mens T20I? or all T20s? 74 in SL innings, 52 in SA innings so far." --- It's definitely the most in T20I WC game. 127 out of 214 balls faced by the batters in this game were dots. The previous most was 123 dot balls during SA-IND game in 2007 in Durban and the Oman-Namibia game last night. The most in any T20I is 148 dots between Ireland and Kenya in 2008. <B>Anrich Nortje</b> is the Player of the Match for his figures of 4 for 7: "It's been a tough few days but we worked really hard. It's just great to get a result and the momentum that goes with it. I'm very happy, been feeling good. It just hasn't paid off in the last few games. But yeah, it's a great result for the team cos it was a tough wicket. Kudos to the team. We didn't know what to expect, we just trying to assess the wicket. I think the boys did really well, especially at the start. So really happy with how it went. Not sure if all the games are going to be like this, so we'll have to keep assessing going forward." <B>1.36pm</b> So despite some nervy moments South Africa eventually secure a resounding win to kick off their WC campaign in style. On a surface that proved to be two-paced to go with some uneven bounce, Sri Lanka might rue the decision to bat first having won the toss. It was pretty much all downhill from that point on as they struggled to come to terms with the sluggish surface, though credit should go for the South African bowlers who gave the SL batters nothing to work with. With just a target of 78, South Africa then inched their way to victory despite the best efforts of the impressive Lankan bowlers.

Sri Lanka might have been expecting a net run rate pounding after being bowled out for 77, but in the end it's definitely recoverable. But now they have no more margin for error going forward. Their next game will be up against Bangladesh on Saturday, but more immediately we have Afghanistan taking on Uganda in another six hours or so, while tomorrow will also see England taking on Scotland in the late game. Be sure to join us for that, but until then, on behalf of Fidel and the rest of the team this is Madushka signing out! <B>Aiden Markram</b>: "Yeah happy with the win. The batting was a little up and down, speaks to quite a tough wicket but we found some way to score runs. It's a tough one from a batting perspective. You try to take the pitch out of it, but if the ball misbehaves or there's low bounce, it's just one of those things and hopefully we can take some learnings out of it. [importance of adapting] Lots of different conditions as you move around the tournament. Obviously fortunate that we have our next two games here, so we know what to expect. But important to assess as you move around. [Nortje] Wasn't worried about him, but it's a fantastic day for him. From a mental point of view, he was massively down [with his recent form], so the boys were really happy for him. And hopefully he kicks on for the rest of the tournament. <B>Wanindu Hasaranga</b>: [right decision to bat first?] Yeah, our batters were looking at 160-170. To be honest this a 120 wicket, especially with our bowlers. [How did you find the pitch?] We went with our bowling strength, that's why we batted first. We wanted to put up a good score and defend it. [Positives] This is early in the tournament, as a team we wanted to do much better especially in the batting. We know we have bowling strength, so if our batters do well we can go further." Karthik: "Could this game have the most dot balls in a Mens T20I? or all T20s? 74 in SL innings, 52 in SA innings so far." --- It's definitely the most in T20I WC game. 127 out of 214 balls faced by the batters in this game were dots. The previous most was 123 dot balls during SA-IND game in 2007 in Durban and the Oman-Namibia game last night. The most in any T20I is 148 dots between Ireland and Kenya in 2008. <B>Anrich Nortje</b> is the Player of the Match for his figures of 4 for 7: "It's been a tough few days but we worked really hard. It's just great to get a result and the momentum that goes with it. I'm very happy, been feeling good. It just hasn't paid off in the last few games. But yeah, it's a great result for the team cos it was a tough wicket. Kudos to the team. We didn't know what to expect, we just trying to assess the wicket. I think the boys did really well, especially at the start. So really happy with how it went. Not sure if all the games are going to be like this, so we'll have to keep assessing going forward." <B>1.36pm</b> So despite some nervy moments South Africa eventually secure a resounding win to kick off their WC campaign in style. On a surface that proved to be two-paced to go with some uneven bounce, Sri Lanka might rue the decision to bat first having won the toss. It was pretty much all downhill from that point on as they struggled to come to terms with the sluggish surface, though credit should go for the South African bowlers who gave the SL batters nothing to work with. With just a target of 78, South Africa then inched their way to victory despite the best efforts of the impressive Lankan bowlers.

Big appeal but think this might be pitching outside leg. Nepal <B>review</b> though. This was tossed up as Miller missed the sweep completely. It pitches and goes on with the arm to strike the back pad. Oh wow, it's pitching in line, and impact in line, but umpire's call as this is deemed to be clipping the top of the bails. Great review, but very unfortunate on the result
