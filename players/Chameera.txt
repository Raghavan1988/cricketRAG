<B>straight as an arrow!</b> Slot ball on off. Chameera clubs it straight back, forcing the umpire to duck, and that's four to end the match. <B>Sri Lanka win by two wickets</b>
That brings us to the end of the proceedings from this thrilling low-scorer. Who would have thought that chasing even 209 would turn out to be a task on what was supposed to be a batting-friendly pitch, and with rain around? But Ngrava's maiden five-for showed Zimbabwe the way, only for them to barely fall short. That's it from us tonight, as we bid you goodbye and good night. Take care! Ran: "I am Sri Lankan , but feel for Ngarava as he bowled brilliantly. " <strong>Kusal Mendis</strong>, the winning captain, speaks in Sinhalese, and says he isn't too happy with how Sri Lanka batted. But he's satisfied with Liyanage's performance, and wants to improve in the future. <strong>Craig Ervine</strong>: "We batted reasonably well. We had a decent platform, but couldn't cash in at the back end. We thought 240-250 was a decent score. Losing so many wickets in the back end put us back. Credit to them. Richie took his maiden five-for... Had we taken the chances, it could have been a different story." <strong>Janith Liyanage is the Player of the Match</strong> for his 95: "The ball was moving a bit when I went to the middle. I thought if I could stay till the end, we could win. It was a bit tricky because the wicket was on the slower side, and the pace varied a bit. [It was] a bit tacky. We were behind on DLS [when I got out], so I thought if we could get four more runs." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> Ash: "Didn't expect such an interesting game. Pity, I couldn't see it live." Zubair Islam: "A real nail-biter. Thank God I don't belong to SL or Zim, otherwise could have been very tense" <B>10.48pm</b> A topsy-turvy game that is eventually decided by a ninth-wicket partnership of 39 in 41 balls. A terrific lower-order resistance from Liyanage, Chameera and Vandersay give the hosts a 1-0 series lead. Don't forget Theekshana's contribution too with the bat, adding to his four-wicket haul that restricted Zimbabwe to 208 in the afternoon. A match to remember for Ngarava for his maiden five-wicket haul, but unfortunately for him, not in a winning cause. A terrific ODI. Himanshu shall bring the presentations shortly.

That brings us to the end of the proceedings from this thrilling low-scorer. Who would have thought that chasing even 209 would turn out to be a task on what was supposed to be a batting-friendly pitch, and with rain around? But Ngrava's maiden five-for showed Zimbabwe the way, only for them to barely fall short. That's it from us tonight, as we bid you goodbye and good night. Take care! Ran: "I am Sri Lankan , but feel for Ngarava as he bowled brilliantly. " <strong>Kusal Mendis</strong>, the winning captain, speaks in Sinhalese, and says he isn't too happy with how Sri Lanka batted. But he's satisfied with Liyanage's performance, and wants to improve in the future. <strong>Craig Ervine</strong>: "We batted reasonably well. We had a decent platform, but couldn't cash in at the back end. We thought 240-250 was a decent score. Losing so many wickets in the back end put us back. Credit to them. Richie took his maiden five-for... Had we taken the chances, it could have been a different story." <strong>Janith Liyanage is the Player of the Match</strong> for his 95: "The ball was moving a bit when I went to the middle. I thought if I could stay till the end, we could win. It was a bit tricky because the wicket was on the slower side, and the pace varied a bit. [It was] a bit tacky. We were behind on DLS [when I got out], so I thought if we could get four more runs." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> Ash: "Didn't expect such an interesting game. Pity, I couldn't see it live." Zubair Islam: "A real nail-biter. Thank God I don't belong to SL or Zim, otherwise could have been very tense" <B>10.48pm</b> A topsy-turvy game that is eventually decided by a ninth-wicket partnership of 39 in 41 balls.

<B>And Sri Lanka have done it!</b> Length ball on off, Chameera chips it in the air but safe towards deep midwicket and they easily run two. Zimbabwe fall agonisingly short, Sri Lanka scrape through by the skin of their teeth as they <b>take a 1-0 lead in the series!</b>
And on that note, it's a wrap from us. A cracking start then to this T20I series, and if the remaining two games are half as entertaining we're in for a scorcher of a series. The next game will be on Tuesday, same time, same place, so be sure to join us for that. Fidel's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/zimbabwe-in-sri-lanka-2023-24-1412536/sri-lanka-vs-zimbabwe-1st-t20i-1412542/match-report">report</a> should be up in a bit, but for now on behalf of the team, this is Madushka signing out! Kashif Hayat: "Sikandar Raza gets nominated for so many awards but he should be given the award of most heartbreaks. For last 5-6 years he gives his everything but ends up on the losing side with his team in a stronger position. Never loses hope and comes back stronger in next game." Neil: "Maybe I'm in a minority, but I don't always think the MOTM should go to someone from the winning team. Mathews was amazing, but Sikandar Raza with 62 and 3-13 in 4 overs was even better!!" <B>Wanindu Hasaranga</b>: "Our bowlers did a great job but our batters should do better. We kept them to 143, and our batters should've gotten us there more easily. We should have better wickets, but our batters still need to show more responsibility. In the middle overs we played a lot of dot balls, that was one mistake. We have a really balanced side, if we play better in the middle overs we could've chased this down better." <B>Sikandar Raza</b>: "This has been the story of Zimbabwe cricket for some time now. But the good thing is everyone understands that the onus is on us to change our fortunes. Very proud of the way we fought today, but unfortunately it's one of those games that's gone to the last ball and we haven't come out on top. I think sometimes the demons of the past come and haunt us but I'm still very confident that these are the group of boys that will change the fortunes of Zimbabwe cricket. Initially I wasn't sure about the way the wicket was changing, but even at the 10-over mark I was saying that 145 would be a decent score on this wicket. But credit to Sri Lanka, needing 37 in the last three overs, the way they batted and finished they put us under pressure. But I thought it was a decent score on this wicket. [Enjoying your cricket?] I would've enjoyed myself a lot more had we won the game. My personal enjoyment comes when we win. My personal enjoyment will be there when we turn Zimbabwe cricket around. That is a promise we have made to our country, that is a promise we have made to our fans. There is no enjoyment until we turn that ship around." <B>Angelo Mathews</b> is the </b>Player of the Match</b> for his 46 off 34: "It felt like I was playing my debut, you know playing after three odd years. I wasn't trying to prove anything to anyone. It was an opportunity for me to go out there and play for Sri Lanka. It was a bit of a slow wicket, not easy to bat on, and I think Dasun played really well towards the end. It wasn't easy, Zimbabwe played really well. It was a challenging total and we needed to get a good start. Unfortunately we lost early wickets and then kept losing wickets in crucial periods. Fortunately for us I stuck in there and then Dasun played brilliantly towards the end." Alright, time then for the post-match presentations Hayes: "How on earth have they done that?" --- Think Zimbabwe will be asking themselves precisely that. Eranga Gune: "SL should re-arrange their batters from bottom to top as they can count on their tail than the top batters." Naveen: "I heard a voice saying, Why Shanaka should be in this team. You got your answer buddy... " Azweer : "Well Played Zimbabwe... Tough luck tonight... " Ran: "as a Sri Lankan supporter I hope Raza is the MOM." Spare a thought though for Sikandar Raza, whose 42-ball 62 with the bat was followed with a <em>nearly</em> match-winning bowling effort of 3 for 13. <B>10.25pm</b> Well what an exhilarating finish to this game and exhilarating start to this T20 series! Sri Lanka have snuck through by three wickets, and off the last ball! And is if it was scripted in the stars it was the wily veteran Angelo Mathews, playing his first T20I in some three years, leading the way with a 38-ball 46, along with the deposed skipper, Dasun Shanaka, whose unbeaten 18-ball 26 ensured his side were in the game right up to the death. Neither though would grab the winning runs, that honour would go to Dushmantha Chameera who scrambled six runs off the final two deliveries to give the home fans some much-needed cheer.
