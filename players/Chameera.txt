Spare a thought though for Sikandar Raza, whose 42-ball 62 with the bat was followed with a <em>nearly</em> match-winning bowling effort of 3 for 13. <B>10.25pm</b> Well what an exhilarating finish to this game and exhilarating start to this T20 series! Sri Lanka have snuck through by three wickets, and off the last ball! And is if it was scripted in the stars it was the wily veteran Angelo Mathews, playing his first T20I in some three years, leading the way with a 38-ball 46, along with the deposed skipper, Dasun Shanaka, whose unbeaten 18-ball 26 ensured his side were in the game right up to the death. Neither though would grab the winning runs, that honour would go to Dushmantha Chameera who scrambled six runs off the final two deliveries to give the home fans some much-needed cheer.
