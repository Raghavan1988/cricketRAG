Madande to face the final delivery

Low, dipping full toss outside off, Madande can only smack it along the ground to long-on for a single to help Zimbabwe finish on 165
<b>2.35pm</b> So Zimbabwe get to 165, which if we are to go by Sean Williams' assessment at the toss, is a score they will be very happy with. It didn't look likely at one point as Zimbabwe collapsed to 78 for 5, but an 87-run stand between Madande and Burl saw the hosts wrestle back the momentum. Williams and Tinashe Kamunhukamwe injected momentum after some early wickets, and then it was all Burl and Madande. Mark Adair was the pick of the bowlers for Ireland, taking pace off from the start in what was the most effective strategy on the day. He picked two wickets and was relatively inexpensive. Unlike in the first game, Ireland were quite sloppy in the field, with three dropped catches and a few misfields. But now their batters will want to get off to a good start in the chase, which will begin soon. Join us in a short bit to find out how Ireland go with the willow!

<B>Madande has done it! Zimbabwe win by four wickets!</b> And what a finish to a fantastic chase! Length ball on the stumps, Madande gets on one knee and hoicks this over deep midwicket! <B>Zimbabwe level the series 1-1!</b>
And on that note it's a wrap from us! Yet another cracking game of cricket is behind us, but there's no doubt this series is poised for a riveting decider on Thursday! Be sure to join us for that, but for now on behalf of the team, this is Madushka signing out! <B>Sikandar Raza</b>: "Like I said in the last game, these are group of boys that will turn this ship around. These are the group of boys that have made a promise to the country and to the fans. And if you'd ask me, I'd rather win two games - the first we got really close - but today was really unbelievable. [From 27 for 4 how did the game slip?] I don't think it slipped, we knew the wicket was going to get better, that there was a bit of moisture and that the first 6-7 overs would be tough. Even when we came back to the changing room, I wasn't angry. I just said they have the momentum, but they haven't got too many runs and it's not like we can't win the game. This was a par score. The wicket got really good, but they played some good shots as well. The whole squad was calm, we didn't want to get it this close but I always say a close game is good for the fans." <B>Wanindu Hasaranga</b>: "Yeah [we had enough runs] but the top order should take more responsibility as I said last time out as well. Angie and Charith played brilliantly though. [Should someone else have bowled the last over?] No Angelo has done it before, I trust him and so I gave it to him." <B>Luke Jongwe</B> is the <B>Player of the Match</b>: "I don't think I even have the words to explain how I'm feeling. I'm just grateful to my teammates, and we've just been playing really hard to get that win out of the way. For the past three months or so I've been in similar situations but couldn't take the team home, I'm just glad and thank God that I was able to do it today." Time then for the post-match presentation GC: "ICC give Zimbabwe more games." Outkast: "Jongwe catch, two wickets and big runs in the end. Should be man of the match." Hayes: "Swings and roundabouts. Hero, game 1, villain, game 2." Ran: "Poor option to use slow medium pacer for the last over." Aby Mathew: "Madande and jongwe would have made even Maxwell proud." Krishna: "It's sad Zimbabwe is not the 2024 T20 WC. These 2 games have been more than competitive. Thrillers to the core!" Galib: "Oh dear! I can't believe my eyes! Finally, Zimbabwe have won a close game! It made my evening. Thank you Zimbabwe! " That much of this Sri Lankan pain came at the hands of Angelo Mathews shows how cruel sport can be, as he spent much of the Lankan innings repairing a top order collapse alongside the outstanding Charith Asalanka. Neither player deserved to be on the losing side, but such is sport and life. <B>10.28pm</b> Well what a difference a couple of days make! Zimbabwe, who were on the wrong end of an unlikely chase a couple of nights back, have now secured a historic one of their own! The hero was undoubtedly Luke Jongwe, maligned for his bowling, but redeeming himself in spades with the bat! But of course none of it would have been possible without Craig Ervine's 54-ball 70, which had anchored the chase for large parts. But just as their hopes seemed to be fading, Jongwe arose with a 12-ball 25, to help plunder 20 off the final over! A word for Clive Madande too, who hit the winning six in a 5-ball 15.

Navod: "Brain Bennett's dismissal in Angelo's second over made the difference " --- Well it was certainly a turning point, though I think the platform he set was more than adequate for the rest of the batters to work around. Especially on a pitch that was showing some assistance for the spinners. Joe: "they lost 8 wickets for 31 runs , after a great start " <B>8.08pm</b> So Sri Lanka end the innings on a team hat trick, and Zimbabwe have been bundled out here for a very sub par total. And no one would have seen it coming when Brian Bennett was flying inside the powerplay during his 12-ball 29, but the visitors just kept losing wickets and were unable to put on partnerships of any note. In fact only one went beyond 20, while all but three of them failed to get into double digits. For Sri Lanka Hasaranga led the way with figures of 4 for 15. Mathews and Theekshana also got two a piece, with Mathews getting the crucial wicket of Bennett. Join me in a bit for the chase.

Madande is OUT! caught
c Shanaka b Theekshana
Clive Madande c Shanaka b Theekshana 5 (10b 0x4 0x6 21m) SR: 50
<B>Three wickets in three balls and it's all wrapped up here!</b> Madande looked to slog sweep this but only managed to top edge it straight up, as Shanaka came running in from the ropes and settled under it near mid-on. <B>Zimbabwe have been bowled out for 82!</b>
Navod: "Brain Bennett's dismissal in Angelo's second over made the difference " --- Well it was certainly a turning point, though I think the platform he set was more than adequate for the rest of the batters to work around. Especially on a pitch that was showing some assistance for the spinners. Joe: "they lost 8 wickets for 31 runs , after a great start " <B>8.08pm</b> So Sri Lanka end the innings on a team hat trick, and Zimbabwe have been bundled out here for a very sub par total. And no one would have seen it coming when Brian Bennett was flying inside the powerplay during his 12-ball 29, but the visitors just kept losing wickets and were unable to put on partnerships of any note. In fact only one went beyond 20, while all but three of them failed to get into double digits. For Sri Lanka Hasaranga led the way with figures of 4 for 15. Mathews and Theekshana also got two a piece, with Mathews getting the crucial wicket of Bennett. Join me in a bit for the chase.
