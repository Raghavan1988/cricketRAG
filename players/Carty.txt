" He had already batted in both innings in the Shield game. Australia also don't have a batting concussion sub. He wasn't in the original squad so it's hard to leapfrog any of those guys.

Keacy Carty c Labuschagne b Morris 10 (22b 0x4 0x6 33m) SR: 45.45
<strong>superb catch from Labuschagne at backward point!</strong> Morris has his first ODI wicket. Back of a length, some extra bounce wide of off, he slices a back foot square drive off the outer half of the bat, Labuschagne flying high to his right with two hands like a goalkeeper reels it in! Outstanding catch. As good as you will see.
