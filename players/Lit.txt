Hits him on the back thigh. And that's hitting the top of middle stump. Litton has played an important knock here, but he will not be able to take Bangladesh over the line today.

<strong>a delayed appeal, but given by the umpire!</strong> Fullish on middle and leg, and this seems to curve away late. Litton, having taken a step down the track, plays all around it and gets pinned on the pads. Kami is not overly convinced but appeals anyway, and his appeal is upheld. Litton, though, wants to have another look. Was it sliding down? It did swing away but it did not necessarily nip away. <strong>No bat involved but Ball Tracking reckons it would have slipped down leg. Litton stays!</strong>

<strong>big shout first up. </strong> Discussion about whether there will be a review. This was a length ball, seaming in slightly, and which hits Litton just above the knee roll on the front foot, after the ball beats the inside edge. <strong>Sri Lanka review. </strong> This seems to have struck the batter in line, but there is a question on whether it is too high. Litton is saved by a whisker! The projection shows it is clipping the bails, but because the on-field decision is not out, it stays umpire's call. Sri Lanka retain the review though.

Muzarabani from the other end Ziad: "Shoriful is just having a bad day, he will come back strong in the next, he has established himself as our premium bowler. I think we need to be patient with Rishad, we dont have wrist spinners and they are crucial to every successful T20 team, plus he is a very good pinch hitter making him ideal for this format of the game."

Maybe due to the time of the year, Chittagong wicket isn't what it is famous for. We have bowled really well." Zimbabwe won the toss and opted to <strong>bowl </strong>first. Ullu: "Do you think Litton Das will be dropped before the world cup because of his recent white ball form? " To be honest, I don't think Bangladesh's management and selection panel will make a significant decision to drop a key player just before the World Cup. They will attempt to go cautiously this year like they have always done. Furthermore, Jaker Ali doesn't appear to be very confident behind the stumps. Litton may therefore also take over the glove work. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, is presently having difficulty establishing the rhythm of the top and middle order. Additionally, their fielding and bowling unit is still lacking. Captain Raza talked about the difficulty of bowling throughout the rain interruption match during the preceding match presentation ceremony. They would be aiming to make up for their issues and play the style of cricket they intended to showcase to the the world. Rather than unduly depending on the younger players, the senior players must take the initiative and divide the workload. The lower middle order knocks by Madande-Masakadza in the first match and Campbell-Bennett in the second were, however, their only bright spots. They would be hoping to settle into the match nicely and get similar scores from the middle and top order. Bangladesh will be really happy with how their bowling lineup performed leading up to the world cup; they kept things tight and didn't bowl many wayward deliveries. However, their batting strategy for the T20I format is still lacking, which worries both management and the supporters. Both of the openers in the previous game were quite settled at the crease when they gave up wickets at a strike rate of less than 100. Shanto, the skipper, also contributed 16(15) innings. Thus, the batting unit's goals will be to improve their strike rate and attempt to bat with an aggressive mindset. Bangladesh is hoping to win today in order to wrap up the series, having already won the first two games. <strong>2.00 pm local time: </strong> Good day to all of you! Welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of Bangladesh vs. Zimbabwe in their third T20I match, which is being held at Chattogram's Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.
