fuller side of a length, and angling into off, as Litton opens the face of the bat to loft over cover. It isn't all that well timed, but the ball still dribbles away

OUT! {"short": "caught", "long": "c Miller b Maharaj", "commentary": "Litton Das c Miller b Maharaj 9 (13b 1x4 0x6 18m) SR: 69.23"}
flung to extra cover! A simple catch arriving in front his stomach. Maharaj tossed this one up, and got it to dip on a very full length on leg stump. Litton had made room, and went to drive hard, but ended up chipping straight to Miller. Clearly beaten by the flight and the dip, even as he played it as a half volley
