Player of the match: Rahmanullah Gurbaz for his brilliant batting, he scored 121, with 8x4s and 6x6s. From Afghanistan Rahmanullah Gurbaz was the star with the bat as he scored 121 runs and Farooqi with the ball took 4-wicket. Early on the partnership of Tector and Tucker gave some hope for the Irish team but Afghan pacers came back strongly and broke that partnership and after that it was getting tough and tough to chase down that target. Tucker scored 85 and Tector battled out single handedly till the end but it was not enough. He scored 138 runs. Excellent bowling performance by Farooqi who took wickets with the new ball and dent them badly and finished with the figure of 4-wicket in the match, which helped Afghanistan to win this match. That is the end of the match. Afghanistan won by 35 runs.

Last delivery. Heat-seeking inswinging yorker towards middle, slammed away to deep midwicket, rushing back for the second, Azam collects the ball but to be fair wasn't quick enough in whipping off the bails and Ireland finish on 178/7. After 10 overs, they looked on song for a 200 total but Pakistan managed to apply the squeeze towards the end and stymied the run-flow, Shaheen Afridi was outstanding today, picked 3/14 and Amir went wicketless while Imad was economical as well
Players are back on the field, we are almost ready for Pakistan's reply. Will they open with Rizwan and Saim again? It's drizzling at the moment, so we'll have a delayed start. It's not that murky, so the delay shouldn't be very long FB: "Excellent final over by Amir. I will pick Amir over Hassan any day " Hussain: "Can i please request to add number with every drop catch in a match - i.e. Fakhar dropped (4th of the inning). This will allow the viewers to understand the match position matter. " Affaan: "Pakistan are missing a key here. Where is Abrar? He has been so good in pakistan against new zealand it would be very sad if he doesn't play regularly in the world cup" Rashid Hussain : "Pakistan lost both of the previous world cups all because of the Hassan Ali he didn't perform in all 3, bowling, fielding and batting. Selectors needs to think and given chance to Muhammad Ali who is much better then Hassan ali" Abbas: "@Sherry, Do you really have some job to do or criticising BABAR for everything is your day-to-day job? If he does not give over to Saim, Babar is wrong. If he gave over to Saim and Saim goes for plenty, it is Babar's mistake. Come on man" Sagor: "I don't understand why Pakistani people blame Babar about the team selection? Seven people are responsible to select team and all have equal power.  But people don't talk about them. They try to ruin their biggest star or their team." Ireland will rue missing out on an opportunity to post 200 after a blazing start and a perfect platform to sping from. They had wickets in hand, but perhaps players like Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker could have stayed longer to do more damage, which wasn't the case. Losing wickets in clusters cost them as Shaheen Afridi looked class apart and picked up regular wickets. He mixed his deliveries superbly, offering a whole buffet of yorkers, bumpers, and change-ups, which bodes well for Pakistan ahead of the England series and World Cup. Ireland will need wickets upfront to make it spicy
