Direct hit and things could have been interesting. Low full toss on off, he pushes to mid-on and sets off. Wellalage  feels the bowler came in his way and has a few words to say to Shoriful. The umpire has to step in. Wellalage has to put in a dive to reach home. There was no direct hit anyway. Things getting heated up.
Looks like Wellalage has hurt himself there. The physio is out.

Surely Wellalage will want to get this done with in the next six balls. Sri Lanka need just two to win. Towhid to bowl from around the wicket

<strong>And that's that!</strong> Short and wide, he stays back and slaps it through covers for a four.
Thanks for joining in today. With the series locked in, it is all to play for when the two teams meet again on March 18. It is going to be a day game, and we will be in nice and early for that. Thanks for tuning in today. On behalf of Madushka, Sudeep and Harshith, this is me Ashish Pant, signing off. Mustafa Moudi : "How is Hasaranga not the Player of the Match despite of his All Round Performance?? He not just took 4 Wickets but controlled the flow of runs too while bowling and scored a quick 25 Runs with the Bat. Might be tough for the Referee but Hasaranga's Performance is more deserving than Nissanka !!" I thought they could have shared it. <b>Kusal Mendis:</b> Firstly, Wanindu bowled really well. And fast bowlers really bowled a couple of good overs. 280 is a very good score in this ground. Wanindu is the main bowler in our team. Batting unit, Pathum and Charith batted really well. Wanindu batted really well in the last few overs. [Final game] I hope we can do our best. Thank You to the Sri Lankan supporters who are here. <b>Pathum Nissanka is the player of the match</b>: [Translated to English by Naveed Nawaz the assistant coach from Sinhalese] After the three wickets fell, Charith and Pathum decided to bat normally and looking at the score to bat long and get close to the target. Initially it was important they settle down, and then they decided one of them could go after the bowlers. <b>Najmul Hossain Shanto</b>: He [Towhid] played very well. That's what we want from him. Really happy for him. On a wicket like this, me and Soumya should have batted longer. We will try the next match. [Bowling] We started really well. Middle overs they batted really well. We will be looking forward to the next match and hope we do something special. Presentation time <b>10.26pm</b> Sri Lanka huff and puff over the line. They really shouldn't have had to after the mammoth Nissanka-Asalanka stand but Bangladesh came back well. Chasing 287, Sri Lanka got off on the wrong foot losing Avishka in the first over. Mendis and Samarawickrama fell in consecutive overs as Sri Lanka slipped to 43 for 3 in 6.1 overs. But Nissanka and Asalanka put on a record 185-run stand to take Sri Lanka forward. Nissanka scored his sixth ODI ton, while Asalanka fell for 91. A rush of wickets got Bangladesh back into the game, but Wanindu Hasaranga and Dunith Wellalage held their nerves to take Sri Lanka over the line by three wickets.
