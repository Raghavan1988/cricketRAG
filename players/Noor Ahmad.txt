Savio: "South Africa missed a trick here. If I were SA, I would "allow" them to score about 270 to 320 runs. Since Qualification is not at stake here, it would have given the team a practice match on how to perform a run chase. Unfortunately, they do not seem to be doing this " -- Bold idea but losing the last game before a semi is not good for morale.
