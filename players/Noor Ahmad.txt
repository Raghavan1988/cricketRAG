Noor Ahmad is OUT! bowled
 b Pathirana
Noor Ahmad b Pathirana 9 (6b 0x4 1x6 5m) SR: 150
<strong>Castled!</strong> The yorker is on target there. Noor Ahmad got nowhere near the last one, he gets nowhere near this one. This one wasn't as full, but it goes under the bat and smashes into off stump. Pathirana has been fantastic today, except that last over when he gave away a bunch of wides. Other than that, absolutely brilliant!

Afghanistan will be happy with just singles here. Sri Lanka need wickets and/or dots!

Yorker at 153kph, but it's just outside off! Zooms past the off stump!

<strong>appeal, not given!</strong> Sizzling yorker on middle and off. Noor tries to flick it away and might have gotten a scratch before the ball thudded into his back pad. The umpire thinks so too and does not raise his finger. Sri Lanka, though, have taken this upstairs. <strong>Replays confirm that Noor has absolutely smashed it into his pad. Sri Lanka lose a review!</strong>
