From Miller, Vish and Venkat, goodnight! <B>Jos Buttler:</B> "We were confident coming into the game, obviously expected a tough challenge. There's no easy games at all, but we were confident and the disappointment is for everyone isn't it, both sides and all the crowd here. There were probably a couple of balls here and there which you want to tighten up on, but I thought, all in all, with all the conditions and the stops and starts, and then the constraints when we went back out, with certain bowlers already been bowled out as well, I thought we scrapped hard and we were confident of chasing that score down." <B>Richie Berrington:</B> "Everyone's frustrated at not getting a game in. But some positives to take from it at least. The guys who went out to the middle I thought did a really good job. And obviously now, looking ahead, they've had some time out there, so we can take some things from that. But yeah, certainly frustrated that we couldn't get a full game in. "It would have been interesting to see how the weather affects the pitch, because it did look a little bit of uneven bounce through the day. So yeah, I think if we'd bowled well, we certainly had had an opportunity there." <B>2.48pm</B> <B>Match abandoned</B>. It's all over red rover. What a pity. That was tantalisingly set up, but the heavens have had the final say. Cartoft: "A bit unfair to include this in England's record against European teams. What were they supposed to do? Score 75 in 5 overs and declare?" Taking a wicket and not leaving themselves a very tricky chase would have been a start! Besides, they definitely dodged a bullet in their other <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-twenty20-2010-412671/england-vs-ireland-10th-match-group-d-412681/full-scorecard>wash-out against Ireland in 2010</A>, so I don't think it's unfair to point out such a curious record! David C: "Why do Eng have to score 109 when Sco only scored 90 ???" Because they started the innings before they knew it was a reduced chase. It's about a recalibration of resources. If you know you don't need to keep wickets in hand because all that's left is a 22-ball slog, you go harder, don't you? <B>2.45pm</B> We're just killing time now... nothing left to see here. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/netherlands-vs-nepal-7th-match-group-d-1415707/live-cricket-score>Not an awful lot left to see in Dallas either!</A> Mohaimin: "Yeah good job umpires, keep playing a dead innings.

Yes, you would have thought someone somewhere could have predicted this rain, and planned accordingly. There does seem to be quite a lot of it! <B>2.37pm</B> This looks unremittingly bleak. The rain is getting heavier. I don't see any way we can get back on inside the cut-off time.

Fittingly, though, the first T20I between England and Scotland is set to end exactly as the first ODI did, way back at the <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-tour-of-scotland-2008-314672/scotland-vs-england-only-odi-314670/full-scorecard>dawn of time in <S>1872</S> ... 2008!</A> <B>2.32pm</B> The covers are on!</B> Oh pants... that's a lot of ground-sheets in place... it'll take a while to peel those off... 20 minutes until the cut-off... <B>2.26pm</B> Well played Scotland. 90 for 0 in ten overs, with a long rain delay to disrupt their rhythm. They will get a DLS boost to push England's target into three figures. It will be <B>109 to win</B>, which feels less than their endeavours deserve. But it's a score on the board, and a big challenge for the defending champions!
