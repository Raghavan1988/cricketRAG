<strong>7:36pm</strong> Here we go, minutes later than scheduled. Slip in <strong>7:32pm</strong>: Anthems are done. USA's fielders walk out to the middle. Dhaliwal and Johnson are the openers, the latter will take strike. Ali Khan, the slingy pacer, has the new ball. Sightscreen issues creating a delay, Richard Illingworth looks bemused. Ian Bishop says the wind is coming from the RHB's off side to the leg side, which could aid hitting and a tactical factor that could play out. <strong>7:26pm</strong>: The kids are out holding up the two big flags. Umpires Richard Illingworth and Sharfuddoula walk out, the players follow for the National Anthems. Ritu: "Great to see my hubby's (Ashish) comment published in the cricinfo. He is so excited. Thank you Cricinfo :)  Met Gavaskar sir yesterday in a restaurant so immediately got the tickets for the game today. Welcoming the world cup in Dallas :)" Opening ceremony is underway 15 minutes ahead of the start of play. People with colourful shirts walk out with helmets, drums into the smoky outfield. Somersaults are on too. <strong>Pitch and conditions</strong>: Despite the rain, the outfield looks unbelievable, says Natalie Germanos. Dimensions, from the River End - 73-metre boundary straight, 69 and 74 to the left and right respectively. Square boundaries: 61 metres off side and 70 leg side (for the right-hand batters). Fine boundaries are the shortest at 54 and 60 metres. Sunil Gavaskar says there's less grass here than there was in the MLC as there are fewer games. here will be carry for the pacers and the batters will like batting on it too. <strong>Canada playing XI</strong>: 1 Aaron Johnson, 2 Navneet Dhaliwal, 3 Pargat Singh, 4 Nicholas Kirton, 5 Shreyas Movva (wk), 6 Dilpreet Bajwa, 7 Saad Bin Zafar (capt), 8 Nikhil Dutta, 9 Dilon Heyliger, 10 Kaleem Sana, 11 Jeremy Gordon <strong>USA playing XI</strong>: 1 Steven Taylor, 2 Monank Patel (capt), 3 Andries Gous (wk), 4 Aaron Jones, 5 Nitish Kumar, 6 Corey Anderson, 7 Harmeet Singh, 8 Shadley van Schalkwyk, 9 Jasdeep Singh, 10 Ali Khan, 11 Saurabh Netravalkar Saad Bin Zafar: Surface is good, don't mind batting first. This is a World Cup, not a bilateral series, so the pressure will be on. We have a full squad, so confident we'll do well. Historic day for us. First time we're playing in the tournament, hope to do it with a win. Monank Patel: Bowling first because it's a fresh wicket and looks like it'll help the pacers early. Once we know the target, we'll have more clarity. (On hosting the WC opener) It's an amazing feeling. We've sacrificed a lot in the last five years and our journey has been incredible. <strong>7:02pm</strong>: Monank Patel, USA captain, and Saad Bin Zafar, Canada captain, with Ian Smith of the 'barest of margins' fame. Richie Richardson, match referee, is out too. <strong>USA win the toss and will bowl first</strong> Ashish: "From Jaipur, now an American citizen, live watching the match in Dallas to support the new home team :). Btw came to support India in India vs Pak match in the world cup so not have forgotten the roots either!! " <strong>6:55pm</strong>: We are five minutes away from the toss, there are a few representatives with flags, walking out into the outfield and getting in a line. Effi Gorodetzer: "It may be the first ever USA game, but they're coming in with good form, And after beating a full member in Bangladesh if you ask me the home nation might actually surprise you " <strong>Feature by Cameron Ponsonby</strong>: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/dallas-dreams-of-cricket-1435655">Dallas dreams of cricket</a> - Blessed with good weather, a large South Asian diaspora, and having hosted the MLC, the Texan city is well on its way to becoming the cricket hub of the USA Sivabalan: "I live in north of Dallas, few days back we had a lot of thunderstorms, tornadoes but glad things are back to normal.

USA will continue the tradition of the hosts playing the inaugural match and West Indies, the co-hosts, will face Papua New Guinea tomorrow morning (local time). While the Test-playing nations apart from Zimbabwe have played in all editions of the tournament, there are a few first-timers, including both USA and Canada. Nepal are making a return after a ten-year gap. <strong>6:30pm</strong>: Grand Prairie in Texas (just outside Dallas), where warm-ups are underway, is a strong base for cricket in the USA. Their 7000-seater stadium provides a cosy venue for this tournament opener. <strong>The weather is clear for now</strong>, there are a few clouds about but amid bits of blue skies. However, how the ground conditions hold up after a storm last week and rain earlier today, is yet to be determined. USA played Bangladesh right here in their T20I series, and their players are familiar with this venue courtesy the MLC tournament that was held here <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/major-league-cricket-2023-1357742/match-schedule-fixtures-and-results?ground=3640">in 2023</a>. They will indeed miss the company of Nitish Kumar, the former Canada player who has now moved to represent USA, but in Aaron Johnson have one of the most destructive batters from the region. Johnson's T20I career, albeit short, has been exceptional; he is already the only Canadian to hit multiple T20I centuries (2), while also averaging 50.9 and striking at nearly 167. Canada qualified for their first T20 World Cup after winning the Americas qualifier last year, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-americas-region-final-2023-24-1399133/bermuda-vs-canada-12th-match-1399161/full-scorecard">overcoming Bermuda in the final</a> to secure their place.

He has since gone on to become the most successful captain for USA in T20Is, enjoying a win percentage of 79.4%.   Patel's notable performances include successive half-centuries against Canada and a match-winning 42 against Bangladesh in Grand Prairie itself. <strong>6:20pm</strong>: International Cricket's original rivalry, a contest going back as far as <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/canada-tour-of-united-states-of-america-1844-318993/united-states-of-america-vs-canada-318995/full-scorecard">1844</a>, is set to be reignited as United States of America take on Canada in both sides' maiden outing in the T20 World Cup. Both North American qualifiers for the T20 World Cup have a tough task in Group A - that also features Ireland, India and Pakistan - but come into the tournament with some promise. USA, rejuvenated by some new additions like Corey Anderson to their set-up, have <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/usa-vs-bangladesh-2024-1425119">beaten a full strength Bangladesh 2-1</a> in the T20I series last month to show they belong.

<strong>Slapped off the toe of the bat and it's taken at long-off!</strong> Harmeet slowed down the pace after predominantly darting the ball so far, Johnson backed away and tried to belt it off side, but made a bit too much room and lost balance. He was falling over leg side and the bat was going the other way. Easy catch and Harmeet is jubilant. The opener gave his side a good start though

Canada has nothing to lose and a very good chance to topple the 2022 finalists." <b>10.02am: Pakistan win the toss and bowl</b>, Babar Azam notes the morning start and a "bit of grass" on the pitch in his decision-making. They have also made a change to their XI, bringing in Saim Ayub at the top of the order and leaving out Iftikhar Ahmed. Ayub had been given a chance to open at the start of the year but couldn't cement his place before Paksitan went back to Babar and Mohammad Rizwan. Canada's Saad Bin Zafar says he would have bowled to, but isn't unhappy. "If we can put a good score on the board, we back ourselves to defend it." They have one change, too: Dilpreet Bajwa is replaced by Ravinderpal Singh, who comes in for his first World Cup appearance <b>Pakistan:</b> 1 Mohammad Rizwan (wk), 2 Saim Ayub, 3 Babar Azam (capt), 4 Fakhar Zaman, 5 Usman Khan, 6 Shadab Khan, 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Shaheen Shah Afridi, 9 Naseem Shah, 10 Haris Rauf, 11 Mohammad Amir <b>Canada:</b> 1 Aaron Johnson, 2 Navneet Dhaliwal, 3 Pargat Singh, 4 Nicholas Kirton, 5 Shreyas Movva (wk), 6 Ravinderpal Singh, 7 Dilon Heyliger, 8 Saad Bin Zafar (capt), 9 Kaleem Sana, 10 Junaid Siddiqui, 11 Jeremy Gordon <b>9.55am:</b> Ashish Pant is manning the<a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/canada-vs-pakistan-22nd-match-group-a-1415722/live-match-blog> live blog</a> today, and doubtless there'll be plenty to talk about if the previous matches at Nassau County International Stadium are anything to go by.

"Get Fakhar to open. a) fakhar is more aggresive b) LH-RH combo. So, Either Babar / Rizwan should drop down. Don't hesitate to send a pinch hitter.

Looks like Shaheen Afridi to take the new ball. Aaron Johnson on strike for Canada. Two slips in place "One of my favorite things to watch in this World Cup has been seeing Saad Bin Zafar during the Canadian anthem.  Every game, he's singing so proudly and looks to be on the verge of tears.  Shows how much it means to these players to be here." And today he's playing against the country of his birth, Eli Meanwhile, fighting talk, from Kelly: "Pakistan is on brink, just need little push from Canada for a knockout punch." <b>10.25am:</b> Anthems done, the players are assembling on the edge of the field.

They did, however, manage to win batting first against Ireland, and will believe that Pakistan's buttons can be pushed in the chase should they post a halfway decent total On the subject of Pakistan's opening combination, here's Urooj Mumtaz from our preview show: Manu Ajmani: "As much as Pakistan is the unanimous dark horses of any global cricket tournament ever, they must be hurting and must be pretty low on confidence after the two close games. Canada has nothing to lose and a very good chance to topple the 2022 finalists." <b>10.02am: Pakistan win the toss and bowl</b>, Babar Azam notes the morning start and a "bit of grass" on the pitch in his decision-making. They have also made a change to their XI, bringing in Saim Ayub at the top of the order and leaving out Iftikhar Ahmed. Ayub had been given a chance to open at the start of the year but couldn't cement his place before Paksitan went back to Babar and Mohammad Rizwan. Canada's Saad Bin Zafar says he would have bowled to, but isn't unhappy. "If we can put a good score on the board, we back ourselves to defend it." They have one change, too: Dilpreet Bajwa is replaced by Ravinderpal Singh, who comes in for his first World Cup appearance <b>Pakistan:</b> 1 Mohammad Rizwan (wk), 2 Saim Ayub, 3 Babar Azam (capt), 4 Fakhar Zaman, 5 Usman Khan, 6 Shadab Khan, 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Shaheen Shah Afridi, 9 Naseem Shah, 10 Haris Rauf, 11 Mohammad Amir <b>Canada:</b> 1 Aaron Johnson, 2 Navneet Dhaliwal, 3 Pargat Singh, 4 Nicholas Kirton, 5 Shreyas Movva (wk), 6 Ravinderpal Singh, 7 Dilon Heyliger, 8 Saad Bin Zafar (capt), 9 Kaleem Sana, 10 Junaid Siddiqui, 11 Jeremy Gordon <b>9.55am:</b> Ashish Pant is manning the<a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/canada-vs-pakistan-22nd-match-group-a-1415722/live-match-blog> live blog</a> today, and doubtless there'll be plenty to talk about if the previous matches at Nassau County International Stadium are anything to go by.

Even though it takes qudrat ka nizam and external circumstances but in the end I believe everything will fall back into pieces for this team to win and qualify for the super 8" Shell DON is feeling a different vibe, though: "Waiting for a heartbreak to take place today Go CANADA" "Pakistan need a very simple and logical tweak to their batting order," says Somwya. "Get Fakhar to open. a) fakhar is more aggresive b) LH-RH combo. So, Either Babar / Rizwan should drop down. Don't hesitate to send a pinch hitter. Let Shaheen , who is a capable batter, be an option." <b>9.35am:</b> Hello and welcome. Are Pakistan heading back to the Heartbreak Hotel?

<b>put a donk on it, son... Fifty up for Johnson, via his fourth six!</b> Soft-shoes to the pitch and flips it down the ground, lots of hang time but the ball drops safely over the head of long-off coming around. He raises his bat to the crowd. Proper Bannerman territory for Johnson now

Aaron Johnson b Naseem Shah 52 (44b 4x4 4x6 64m) SR: 118.18
<b>backs away, swings hard - and misses!</b> Johnson's one-man show is over. Looked a tired shot, that... he trudges off slowly, just a brief wave of the bat to the crowd. Naseem hit back of a length and the ball skidded on, cramping Johnson as he looked to mow through the off side. Smack into the top of leg stump
Kaleem Sana is the new batter
