Ali Khan, the slingy pacer, has the new ball. Sightscreen issues creating a delay, Richard Illingworth looks bemused. Ian Bishop says the wind is coming from the RHB's off side to the leg side, which could aid hitting and a tactical factor that could play out. <strong>7:26pm</strong>: The kids are out holding up the two big flags. Umpires Richard Illingworth and Sharfuddoula walk out, the players follow for the National Anthems. Ritu: "Great to see my hubby's (Ashish) comment published in the cricinfo. He is so excited. Thank you Cricinfo :)  Met Gavaskar sir yesterday in a restaurant so immediately got the tickets for the game today. Welcoming the world cup in Dallas :)" Opening ceremony is underway 15 minutes ahead of the start of play. People with colourful shirts walk out with helmets, drums into the smoky outfield. Somersaults are on too. <strong>Pitch and conditions</strong>: Despite the rain, the outfield looks unbelievable, says Natalie Germanos. Dimensions, from the River End - 73-metre boundary straight, 69 and 74 to the left and right respectively. Square boundaries: 61 metres off side and 70 leg side (for the right-hand batters). Fine boundaries are the shortest at 54 and 60 metres.

This is a World Cup, not a bilateral series, so the pressure will be on. We have a full squad, so confident we'll do well. Historic day for us. First time we're playing in the tournament, hope to do it with a win. Monank Patel: Bowling first because it's a fresh wicket and looks like it'll help the pacers early. Once we know the target, we'll have more clarity. (On hosting the WC opener) It's an amazing feeling. We've sacrificed a lot in the last five years and our journey has been incredible. <strong>7:02pm</strong>: Monank Patel, USA captain, and Saad Bin Zafar, Canada captain, with Ian Smith of the 'barest of margins' fame. Richie Richardson, match referee, is out too. <strong>USA win the toss and will bowl first</strong> Ashish: "From Jaipur, now an American citizen, live watching the match in Dallas to support the new home team :).

Aaron Johnson on strike for Canada. Two slips in place "One of my favorite things to watch in this World Cup has been seeing Saad Bin Zafar during the Canadian anthem.  Every game, he's singing so proudly and looks to be on the verge of tears.  Shows how much it means to these players to be here." And today he's playing against the country of his birth, Eli Meanwhile, fighting talk, from Kelly: "Pakistan is on brink, just need little push from Canada for a knockout punch." <b>10.25am:</b> Anthems done, the players are assembling on the edge of the field. The stands are far from full but there's a good smattering of Pakistan support visible <b>You can follow the LIVE ball-by-ball commentary of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/hindi/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/canada-vs-pakistan-22nd-match-group-a-1415722/live-cricket-score">Canada vs Pakistan match in Hindi</a> as well</b> <b>10.15am:</b> This is a fresh surface, the fourth drop-in at Nassau County - and if it plays like the others, then Canada will have their work cut out. They did, however, manage to win batting first against Ireland, and will believe that Pakistan's buttons can be pushed in the chase should they post a halfway decent total On the subject of Pakistan's opening combination, here's Urooj Mumtaz from our preview show: Manu Ajmani: "As much as Pakistan is the unanimous dark horses of any global cricket tournament ever, they must be hurting and must be pretty low on confidence after the two close games. Canada has nothing to lose and a very good chance to topple the 2022 finalists." <b>10.02am: Pakistan win the toss and bowl</b>, Babar Azam notes the morning start and a "bit of grass" on the pitch in his decision-making. They have also made a change to their XI, bringing in Saim Ayub at the top of the order and leaving out Iftikhar Ahmed. Ayub had been given a chance to open at the start of the year but couldn't cement his place before Paksitan went back to Babar and Mohammad Rizwan. Canada's Saad Bin Zafar says he would have bowled to, but isn't unhappy. "If we can put a good score on the board, we back ourselves to defend it." They have one change, too: Dilpreet Bajwa is replaced by Ravinderpal Singh, who comes in for his first World Cup appearance <b>Pakistan:</b> 1 Mohammad Rizwan (wk), 2 Saim Ayub, 3 Babar Azam (capt), 4 Fakhar Zaman, 5 Usman Khan, 6 Shadab Khan, 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Shaheen Shah Afridi, 9 Naseem Shah, 10 Haris Rauf, 11 Mohammad Amir <b>Canada:</b> 1 Aaron Johnson, 2 Navneet Dhaliwal, 3 Pargat Singh, 4 Nicholas Kirton, 5 Shreyas Movva (wk), 6 Ravinderpal Singh, 7 Dilon Heyliger, 8 Saad Bin Zafar (capt), 9 Kaleem Sana, 10 Junaid Siddiqui, 11 Jeremy Gordon <b>9.55am:</b> Ashish Pant is manning the<a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/canada-vs-pakistan-22nd-match-group-a-1415722/live-match-blog> live blog</a> today, and doubtless there'll be plenty to talk about if the previous matches at Nassau County International Stadium are anything to go by. After Pakistan's stuttering start to the tournament, Gary Kirsten had a message for his batter: <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-pak-t20-world-cup-2024-gary-kirsten-to-pakistan-senior-pros-evolve-or-get-left-behind-1437967>evolve or get left behind</a>. That goes back to an ongoing debate about their batting - for that, <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-pak-t20-world-cup-2024-old-debate-simple-answer-pakistans-batting-just-not-very-good-1437864>please read Osman Samiuddin</a>.

Go get some Here's Umer: "Believe it or not, I still think Pakistan will qualify for the super 8. Even though it takes qudrat ka nizam and external circumstances but in the end I believe everything will fall back into pieces for this team to win and qualify for the super 8" Shell DON is feeling a different vibe, though: "Waiting for a heartbreak to take place today Go CANADA" "Pakistan need a very simple and logical tweak to their batting order," says Somwya. "Get Fakhar to open. a) fakhar is more aggresive b) LH-RH combo. So, Either Babar / Rizwan should drop down. Don't hesitate to send a pinch hitter. Let Shaheen , who is a capable batter, be an option." <b>9.35am:</b> Hello and welcome. Are Pakistan heading back to the Heartbreak Hotel? We're on Long Island once again for what could be the last knockings of their campaign - or is it the moment when <i>qudrat ka nizam</i> kicks in? Canada currently sit above them in the points table and defeat would end the involvement of the 2022 finalists. But not for nothing are Pakistan known as mercurial masters of mayhem, and from the low ebb of defeat to India on Sunday, who knows what could be in store. We'll have news from the toss shortly, while <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/canada-vs-pakistan-22nd-match-group-a-1415722/match-preview>Danyal Rasool's preview</a> is the place to go right now
