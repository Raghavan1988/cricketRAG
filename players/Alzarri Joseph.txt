Raghav : "Is Jason Holder no longer in the scheme of things for WI? I feel that he could have been a sturdy all-rounder with skills tailormade for a situation like this. Holder could have converted a now-likely 170-odd to 220 or so." He's taken a break from Tests to focus on playing the T20 World Cup

<b>4.30pm</b> That's the end of a woeful performance from West Indies. No other way to describe that. Australia were very good, but no way can you justify 86 all out. Another four wickets for Xavier Bartlett. Only down side for the home side was the side injury to Lance Morris. "Nice to be on the end of that one," says Adam Zampa. "Happy with that one. Those guys bowling upfront for us are very skillful." Alex will be with you for the start of the chase in just under half an hour.

Alzarri Joseph c Hardie b Bartlett 6 (9b 0x4 0x6 18m) SR: 66.66
<strong>taken at long-off! </strong>Full outside off, Joseph aiming to launch it down the ground, can't get enough of it
<b>4.30pm</b> That's the end of a woeful performance from West Indies. No other way to describe that. Australia were very good, but no way can you justify 86 all out. Another four wickets for Xavier Bartlett. Only down side for the home side was the side injury to Lance Morris. "Nice to be on the end of that one," says Adam Zampa. "Happy with that one. Those guys bowling upfront for us are very skillful." Alex will be with you for the start of the chase in just under half an hour.

connects with a drive this time, finds cover, it's a tight run...doesn't go to the third umpire. <b>Hang on, he's well short!</b> "There was no appeal," says umpire Abood. This is bizarre. Tim David insists he appealed. Mitch Marsh gets involved to calm things down. "Get on with the game," Abood says. This is quite heated. Australia not allowed to appeal for it after the fact

Alzarri Joseph b Boult 6 (6b 1x4 0x6 6m) SR: 100
<strong>cleans him up!</strong> Back of a length just outside off. Skids on low and comes back in with the angle. Joseph is late to get his bat down, beaten by the inward movement and the lack of bounce. Kisses the outside of off stump, and the Kiwis are just one wicket away from bowling West Indies out!

<strong>gets it away!</strong> Slower delivery dug into the track on leg stump. Joseph gets inside the line, rolls his wrists and tickles it past short fine leg. Southee cannot catch up and those are four vital runs!
