<strong>Mavuta knocks over Campher!</strong> Mavuta holds his nerve and bowls it similarly full. If anything, this might have been fuller and slightly quicker. Campher swipes across the line but because of how full the ball is, it sneaks under his bat and smashes into middle stump. A superb 66-run knock but Campher will be gutted having not taken his team past the finish line here!

Kharote and Alikhil are delighted, and Campher is given out caught behind. Campher, though, walks back with a small face full of disappointment. Kharote bowled a full delivery, getting it to angle in, and pitching on leg. It went on with the angle from around the wicket, as Campher looked to clip after getting back in the crease. But it was gobbled by the keeper, although if it came off the inside edge or off the pad remains unclear

Shortens his length and doesn't offer any room to free arms, he goes for the pull looking a bit ungainly, but manages to get something on it and Azam is not even going for the run-out as the duo scampers a single and GET OVER THE LINE. Ireland win by five wickets! Pakistan look crestfallen while Ireland players and fans are over the moon! After suffering a 2-1 series defeat against Afghanistan, they have bounced back emphatically and humbled the strong Pakistan side
This is Rvel Zahid signing off. Thank you for your company and comments! <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> Our start in the first six overs was not good. The pitch was two-paced. We recovered well.  I think 190 would have been a par score. We lost in the bowling and fielding; don't think we executed the plans. Few fielding lapses cost us. We attacked in the first six overs but didn't finish well. I think we were ahead in the first 10 overs but not in the last 10 overs. <strong>Paul Stirling, Ireland Captain:</strong> We are absolutely delighted. We wanted to start the summer off well and it was almost a perfect day for us. When you come here, especially from Pakistan, the flattest pitches in the world, ask them to bat first and see what they can get. We were happy to chase 180. Brilliant knock from Balbirnie, he got through the powerplay and picked up the pace later. It was a fantastic knock. We have had great games here especially against Pakistan. Absolutely delighted to get over the line. <strong>Andrew Balbirnie, Player of the Match:</strong> I didn't watch the last over; went to the tent and put a towel over my head. I felt it was my job to get the team over the line. I believe Curtis (Campher) played a ramp shot. To do that in a  pressure situation was great. Harry said if we could bat normally till the 13th over, we could get the runs. That was a partnership which set it up. Yes, I was disappointed to get out on the full toss. Saad : "From being a no 1 t20I team to a point where we have to dig deep to even win a match from sides which haven't achieved a lot in this format " Syed Sharique: "Babar is good for nothing , replacing captain will not change anything. From no 1 during Sarfaraz period to no 7 or 8 with Babar - what does it indicate?" Naeem Chishti: "Well done Ireland. You have shaken Pakistan when world cup is right at the corner!" Sadiq: "I live in Galway, Ireland. Thanks God, I didn't go to watch the game live in Dublin" Salman Ali: "A yearlong journey: three PCB CEOs, multiple coaches, and new captains for each series, leading to a continuous rotation. A truly disheartening situation." Rodney: "Unable to get the right 11 combination, not having the right people in the right positions, trying to forcefully fit in Rizwan, not utilizing the bowlers properly are just some of things they need to sort out quickly. Who is to take responsibility, the captain or the management?" Minty: "The issue I've noticed with this Pakistan team is that, while on paper they seem formidable, nobody seems to be in any good rhythm... just goes to show how important form is." Right from the start, Ireland made it clear that they weren't just looking to compete but were resolute on winning the game. Their fielding was exceptional, and they didn't let Pakistan off the hook in the middle overs. They performed fairly well at the death too. The partnership between Andrew Balbirnie and Harry Tector kept them alive in the contest, as they kept finding the odd boundary, never really allowing the asking rate to get way out of hand. Ireland had the platform to spring from, and Dockrell played a gem of an innings, as did Campher towards the end. The energy, attitude, determination, and fight from Ireland were exemplary, while Pakistan found themselves stuck in a rut and seemed to lack belief in themselves to win towards the end. It's becoming a pattern for them to slip from strong positions, and the body language looked a bit off too. The fielding was a bit shabby as well. Abbas Afridi looked a bit out of sorts in that last over. Naseem Shah was not at his belligerent best and lacked the kind of consistency we have always associated with him. Perhaps he is not 100% after that shoulder injury. There are a few worrying signs for Pakistan with the T20 World Cup just a month away. Not naming the squad has unnecessarily put pressure on the players who are still jostling for places, and so the lack of clarity in decision-making and planning might be denting their confidence as well. Babar needs to be proactive with his bowling changes and field placement, rather than allowing the game to slip away. Furthermore, he needs to raise his tactical acumen. Also, I think that Shadab as a complete wicket-taking bowler is more important to Pakistan than a lower-order batter and his bowling form has seen a dip over the last year or so which is affecting Pakistan's balance Pakistan have two more games left in the series to fix the chinks in the armor. They need to go back to the drawing board, address the issues, and do some soul-searching because the clock is ticking fast. Pakistan might do themselves a favor by fielding their best 11, the team they want to play with in the World Cup in all the remaining matches before the showpiece event.

Shortens his length and doesn't offer any room to free arms, he goes for the pull looking a bit ungainly, but manages to get something on it and Azam is not even going for the run-out as the duo scampers a single and GET OVER THE LINE. Ireland win by five wickets! Pakistan look crestfallen while Ireland players and fans are over the moon! After suffering a 2-1 series defeat against Afghanistan, they have bounced back emphatically and humbled the strong Pakistan side
This is Rvel Zahid signing off. Thank you for your company and comments! <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> Our start in the first six overs was not good. The pitch was two-paced. We recovered well.  I think 190 would have been a par score. We lost in the bowling and fielding; don't think we executed the plans. Few fielding lapses cost us. We attacked in the first six overs but didn't finish well. I think we were ahead in the first 10 overs but not in the last 10 overs. <strong>Paul Stirling, Ireland Captain:</strong> We are absolutely delighted.
