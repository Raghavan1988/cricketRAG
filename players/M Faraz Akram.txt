So that's it for the time being. Thank you very much for joining; it was a pleasure to have you here. Please head to the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka, on May 10th at 6 p.m. for the fourth T20I. Rashad here to sign off until then on behalf of Sudeep and the entire crew. Goodnight and goodbye. <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto:</strong> "(Winning the series) Yes, the boys showed a lot of character. Especially today the way Hridoy and Jaker batted in the middle. I am really happy for them.  (Death bowling concern) Obviously, I think we need to execute our plan and we didn't bowl well in the last five overs. So we have to improve that area. Looking forward to next match and hopefully we will comeback strongly." <strong>Player of the Match Towhid Hridoy: </strong> "(Two MOTM in Two) Alhamdulillah {All praise to The Almighty} Actually I tried to execute my plan. The situation was we lost early wickets and I just tried to execute the plan. Today the wicket was a bit slow. That's why we took time, I told my partner to do the same, after we are set we will execute." <strong>Sikandar Raza:</strong> "(Spirit and fight back) Yeah that was the case. But the elephant in the room remains there. The fact that the top 5 including myself have to raise our hands for the failure. Bangladesh have shown us that one guy can get set and the others can bat around him. This target was chasable. The dull look on my face is because of the elephant remains in the room. Our batters need to get better a lot. The last few games the runs came from the all rounders and the bowlers. So the batters have to raise their heads and it has been the issue for quite some time. I know we are working really hard but it has to happen. (Bowling unit) I think it is easy to look at it as a whole game but let's not go too far ahead because Richard (Ngarava) is injured and he has been our premium death bowler for a long time. Blessing was exceptional today. We have got a lot of young guys coming up from here and there in the system. Mistakes I can accept because that's how they learn but unfortuately you can't expect the youngsters to come up against Bangladesh, a ready side, and perform very well. These are the good lessons you can learn when you play against Bangladesh and the other sides, especially when you tour away. Due to lack of experience they made mistakes and I can expect that. (Batting depth) Those three youngsters (Campbell, Faraz and Wellington) played extremely well and they were exceptional. I thought they brought the game so close and at one point we thought we will win the match. I guess from entertaining point of view it was an entertaining game. Our graph is getting better in every game and we are looking up things. There are lot more positives than negatives. But the only negative is the top 5 not getting enough runs including myself and I think I am the biggest culprit in these losses at the moment." <strong>Presentation Ceremony: </strong> Bangladesh leads the five-match series 3-0 after winning the match by a margin of nine runs. Zimbabwe struggled throughout the innings and at one point found themselves stranded on 91-7. Following that, Wellington Masakadza and Faraz Akram formed a partnership of 54(30) after the latter scored a rapid 34(19) cameo. At the end of the innings, things were starting to go Zimbabwe's way, but the Bangladeshi bowlers were able to remain composed and win the game. Both Saifuddin and Rishad claimed three wickets each, though at a very costly price. Each of the other bowlers claimed a wicket. Mustafa Moudi: "Finally a Last over thriller this series. 4 of the Zimbabwe's Top 5 got out for a single-digit score. The Top 5 needs to contribute if they are win any match this series !!" <strong>Bangladesh won the match by 9 runs.</strong>
