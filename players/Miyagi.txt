<strong>that is as plumb as it can get!</strong> Length just outside off, and this decks back in sharply. Keeps extraordinarily low too and smacks into the pad, almost up around the shins. Southee goes up and Paul Reiffel upholds the appeal. <strong>Miyagi has reviewed it because, well, why not. Clear gap between bat and ball, and Ball Tracking has it pummelling middle of middle stump. Uganda nine down now!</strong>
