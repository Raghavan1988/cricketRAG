<strong>dropped! And a No ball has been called too, and Gurbaz is down on the deck - it is all happening here!</strong> Back of a length outside off. Ibrahim gives himself room and lofts it towards long off. The fielder runs to his left, gets both hands to it but spills it. The ball then seems to roll away into the cushion. The fielder, thinking the ball is still in play, got it back to the bowler's end, where Gurbaz was scrambling to complete the run. Ended up with a blow on the right knee for his toil!

Ibrahim looks at the flight and hares down, only to realise he has been deceived in the air.

Ibrahim and Noor Ali walk out to open for Afghanistan. Adair has the new ball for Ireland, with the ball expected to move around for the first few overs. It is bright and sunny, and three slips and a gully await. Here we go. Kefayatullah Ra: "Eagerly waiting for the classy Rahmanullah Gurbaz 100 in Test cricket" Thanks Ekanth, and morning, everyone. The Tolerance Oval in Abu Dhabi is making its Test debut, exactly like Gurbaz from Afghanistan, and McCarthy, Woerkom and Young for Ireland. <strong>9:55am</strong> The players are out for the anthems.

Craig Young, Barry McCarthy and Theo van Woerkom will be on debut. <strong>Hashmatullah Shahidi, Afghanistan captain</strong>: The reason is the wicket looks good and we expect spin in the last innings.

Let's find out what the captains said at the toss Here's what Niall O'Brien said about the pitch: It's a beautiful venue, looks pleasant. The pitch looks good, Only 2.5 mm of grass and it's dry underneath. No water on it since four days and there's been four days of rolling. The ball won't zip about, the pace will be steady. The first session might assist pacers but batters can cash in in the sunshine if they get past the new ball. The telecast starts a couple of minutes later. The skies are as blue as expected, the sun is out and the outfield looks pristine. <strong>9:39am</strong> Afghanistan have won the toss will bat first Conditions are unknown at the 122nd venue in Test cricket.

a half-hearted appeal for lbw, but I'm sure there was bat involved. He looked to clip this length delivery on the stumps, with the ball straightening on middle. But replays show he was first hit on his front pad, before it went on to hit his back thigh

Young will resume play. Two slips, and a gully. <strong>12.35pm</strong> Welcome back for the afternoon session. We're full with lunch - don't ask me what I munched, please - but Ibrahim will look to continue from where he left off before the break. The ball was turning for the spinners, and bouncing well for the pacers, as Ireland struck three times.

<strong>ahh, beaten on the inside edge!</strong> Ibrahim looked to defend from sixth stump, but the length ball outside off went between his bat and the stumps

Well taken by Tucker, who tumbled to his left, while almost being blinded by the batter.

That is a lovely delivery, Fuller in length, pitched on middle stump and swung back into the right hander, tried to play across the line, missed it and took it on the pad, loud shout for lbw, turned down, looked like it was angling down the leg side. And there are no reviews in this series.

a bit of a leading edge, and taken by mid-off! Well grabbed by Tector, as he had to move across to his left. Rather, the ball came off the outside half of the bat, and ballooned up to end wide of mid-off. Adair went full and angled this in to pitch on off, with the length being too full to facilitate Ibrahim's attempted loft again

<strong>Ibrahim Zadran</strong>: "We have put a nice total. We are a few runs short, but no problem, we'll try to cover that with fielding. As a batsman, I'm happy. If you look at the last two games, we didn't have a good start in the powerplay. So we discussed that. I was trying to rotate the strike; that is my role in the team - to bat till the 15th [over]. We were trying to make small partnerships. It [the total] is enough." <strong>9.45pm</strong> Ibrahim leads the way with 72*, his career-best T20I score, as Afghanistan post a competitive score on a slow, used pitch. There was not much support for Ibrahim otherwise, even as Ishaq chipped in with some useful runs. All six Ireland bowlers take a wicket each - the other was a run-out - but once again, it was Little who stood out. Join us in 15 for the Ireland chase.

It takes the outside edge and flies into the hands of slip, where main man Nissanka is waiting.

Full outside off, Ibrahim drives it over cover for a boundary, but <b>Sri Lanka win a thriller!</b> Ibrahim's valiant effort in the end not enough, as Sri Lanka's bowlers <b>eke out a four-run victory!</b>
<b>10.55pm</b> That's all from Dambulla today. Some excellent individual performances. Sri Lanka and Afghanistan will also both be happy with how they went about things in the field and between the wickets. Madushka Balasuriya's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-1st-t20i-1416077/match-report">report</a> will be up soon. For now, this is Abhimanyu signing off on behalf of our scorer Chetan Kumar and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Good night! <b>10.47pm</b> Time for the presentation ceremony <b>Matheesha Pathirana is the player of the match!</b> "Always wanted to win this match. Played so long after my debut in T20s. Don't know how to express my happiness. I bowled in these phases a lot of the time, in IPL also, so i have some experience. [The 19th over] My mind was just 'I want to win this match' so I tried whatever I could do and it worked." Sri Lanka captain <b>Wanindu Hasaranga</b>: "To be honest, we were 15-20 runs short but our bowlers did a great job. [On his knock] When their spinners come, I tried to do my basic things. We played with seven batters and one allrounder and I think batsmen should take more responsibility." Appreciates the sellout crowd at the stadium and requests them to keep turning up for the next two games. Afghanistan captain <b>Ibrahim Zadran</b>: "I don't like losing, but that's part of the game. We gave our best in the field but we will try to come back stronger in the next game. Yes 160 was a chaseable target. We had a good start in the powerplay. We gave them wickets in the middle, our batsmen didn't take the responsibility. I can give credit to Sri Lankan bowlers, the way they bowled. They turned the game away from us. [On his knock] To be honest, I am happy but not satisfied with that. I wanted to finish that game for my country. I want to finish more games. I will try to improve my batting and win these kind of games." <b>10.40pm</b> So the first ever men's T20I at this ground was a thrilling affair, with the home side victorious in the end! Matheeha Pathirana and Wanindu Hasaranga are the two men they have to thank for that, largely, and of course Binura Fernando, who came back after being expensive in his first three overs to bowl a brilliant final over to Ibrahim Gurbaz while defending 11. The Afghanistan skipper stayed unbeaten till the end, scoring the exact number of runs as Sri Lanka's captain. Hasaranga's belligerent innings saw Sri Lanka get to 160, after they were in trouble at 55 for 1. They could have scored more if not for a late order collapse. But in the end, the bowlers did enough to deny Afghanistan a first win of this tour. Brian: "After being 50 off 39, Ibrahim then makes 17 more off 16 balls through the last 6 overs.Strange to say it, but he lost that match for Afghanistan." That's harsh to say, but Ibrahim does need to work on his power-hitting game. You can't have a lull of six overs without a boundary as a team! But I am sure he will learn quickly, he is an excellent player. TC: "I have been rightfully humbled. That was some excellent work by Binura Fernando in the final over. " Yup, he gave Ibrahim nothing to work with. Nailed those wide yorkers, and saw out those first four balls. Almost got a wicket too. No boundaries given away, it was very well bowled. Great of him to keep his composure despite being under the pump. Akindu: "This has been a real captains game. Brillaint stuff from both zadran and wanindu"

<strong>straight to mid off! Mathews has two!</strong> Change-up on a length outside off. Ibrahim's eyes light up and he thinks he can smash this. Does not go over mid off, though, and he does not keep it down either. Arrows it towards Theekshana, who stoops down low and completes the catch!

<strong>off the mark in style!</strong> Short, wide and that is just what a batter on nought wants. Zadran waits in his crease and cracks it through point for four!

Ibrahim Zadran c Hasaranga b Dananjaya 10 (9b 1x4 0x6 11m) SR: 111.11
<strong>Dananjaya strikes again!</strong> Dangles the carrot on a length on middle and off, and Zadran's eyes light up. He tries to smash it into next week but is not quite to the pitch of the ball. Because he has to reach out, the ball clinks off the toe end and goes miles up. Hasaranga darts in from long on, settles under it and makes no mistake. Vital wicket for Sri Lanka!
