full ball just outside off. Flays a square drive, straight to Maharaj's right at cover. Got one hand to it and that's dropped! Maharaj was flying but perhaps he could've got two hands.

Coetzee is pumped and why not. A beautiful sight of a fast bowler being aggressive there. Short ball going down leg and Zadran's pull has been edged to the keeper moving to his right

overpitched around middle. Attempts the flick but misses. But Zadran goes down and that makes SA wonder... was it toe first? Nope, it's bat, and neither do they review
another delay with Zadran getting a look at. Paul: "Boundary or nothing is a little frustrating, T20 has built some bad habbits for 50 over cricket."
