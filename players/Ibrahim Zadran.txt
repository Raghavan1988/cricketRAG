Kefayatullah Ra: "Eagerly waiting for the classy Rahmanullah Gurbaz 100 in Test cricket" Thanks Ekanth, and morning, everyone. The Tolerance Oval in Abu Dhabi is making its Test debut, exactly like Gurbaz from Afghanistan, and McCarthy, Woerkom and Young for Ireland. <strong>9:55am</strong> The players are out for the anthems. The Soldier's Song from Ireland goes first. Afghanistan's will follow.

But this is how the flip of the coin works. It's tough to have Tests spaced out but it means we don't have pressure looking forward to them. I'll open with Peter Moor, James McCollum misses out. Craig Young, Barry McCarthy and Theo van Woerkom will be on debut. <strong>Hashmatullah Shahidi, Afghanistan captain</strong>: The reason is the wicket looks good and we expect spin in the last innings. Excited about this being our 300th international game. We have two changes from SL Test, Karim Janat comes in and Gurbaz debuts. Let's find out what the captains said at the toss Here's what Niall O'Brien said about the pitch: It's a beautiful venue, looks pleasant. The pitch looks good, Only 2.5 mm of grass and it's dry underneath. No water on it since four days and there's been four days of rolling. The ball won't zip about, the pace will be steady. The first session might assist pacers but batters can cash in in the sunshine if they get past the new ball. The telecast starts a couple of minutes later. The skies are as blue as expected, the sun is out and the outfield looks pristine. <strong>9:39am</strong> Afghanistan have won the toss will bat first Conditions are unknown at the 122nd venue in Test cricket.
