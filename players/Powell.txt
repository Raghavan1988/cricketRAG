Here we go... <strong>9.26pm</strong> Right - the news we've all been waiting for. It's a <strong>9.35pm restart</strong>, with no overs lost. <strong>9.22pm</strong> No restart time just yet. The cut-off time is 10:10pm... oooh hold up, we've got stumps in the ground and players moving from their respective balconies... <strong>9.10pm</strong> Covers coming off, so says Cameron Ponsonby, our man on the ground. They're running the rope around the outfield too. Promising signs... <strong>9.02pm</strong> Looks like the rain has picked up, too. Ian: "If rain stops Powell please do well as we have Hope that our Shepherd will guide us to victory " Ah shame - the rain has got worse. The players are charging off and the groundstaff are charging on. West Indies 6 ahead on DLS...

Flatter, outside off, guided beyond short third and away for four! Perfect start for West Indies after the break
