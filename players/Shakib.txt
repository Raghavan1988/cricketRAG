Theekshana takes an excellent catch running to his left from deep third! This is dug in short and across Shakib, who looks to play the ramp.

Fuller in length on middle and leg, he gets across and flicks to the right of deep backward square leg. Gets back for two or does he? Yes, he does. Shakib ends on 64 off 46 and Bangladesh reach 159.
<b>12.26pm</b> Bangladesh get 159 for 5. They got 54 off the last five overs, mostly in boundaries. It is a good score but will it be enough? Shakib was the glue in that innings as he finishes unbeaten on 64 off 46 balls. Aryan Dutt started well getting Shanto and Litton inside the powerplay. Shakib and Tanzid put on a nice partnership, but regular wickets kept Netherlands in the game. Bangladesh did get close to 160 in the end, thanks mainly to Shakib's fifty, but they need to bowl well to keep Netherlands from chasing this down.

Jayasuriya to get things underway after lunch. Over the wicket to Shakib <strong>12:38pm</strong> Hello and welcome back, everyone. Sri Lanka ripped out three Bangladesh batters in the second hour of the first session and are now in the ascendancy. The good thing for the hosts is that Mominul and Shakib are still around, and both have the wherewithal and know-how to keep this Sri Lankan attack at bay. Reverse-swing was perhaps a feature towards the end of the last session and could be a factor in the afternoon too. With two left-handers out in the middle, de Silva might bring himself back on as well. Lots to look forward to, and this promises to be another fascinating session of Test cricket.
