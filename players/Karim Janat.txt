Great throw from deep backward point. Is that a run-out? No, Janat has just made his ground! Janat cut away a length ball behind point. The throw to Mendis was good as Afghanistan had a bit of hesitation in running the second, but in the end, Janat had just got into the crease when Mendis took the bails off
