soft dismissal chipping to mid-off. Flighted full on off stump by Nisarg, Paudel steps away from leg stump to drive inside out in the air trying to clear Jessy Singh in the ring at mid-off but miscues it and it floats up gently to Jessy who dives forward to pluck this at ankle height.
USA tried to tease Paudel into playing that shot by keeping mid-off inside the ring and the ploy worked.
