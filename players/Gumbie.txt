<strong>1:07pm: </strong>Thank you, Peter. Sean Williams scored a big-daddy hundred and was severe on the hapless United States bowlers. Sikandar Raza is in red-hot form and once again was seen striking effortlessly while Ryan Burl made a quickfire 47 off 16 deliveries that helped put up this seemingly impregnable score on the board. USA couldn't stop the haemorrhaging of runs as they ran into a side which is becoming a juggernaut at home. Players are making their way out in the middle. Zimbabwe will launch an all-out attack with this massive total to defend

Starts off with a length delivery shaping away from the southpaw who leans out and taps it on the up to short cover

Drinks taken at the fall of the wicket. USA might regret taking that wicket. Because all it means is that Sikandar Raza is coming to the middle. Zimbabwe are a good shot to make 375 from here, especially since USA is without their two best bowling options, who are also their two best death bowling options, Ali Khan and Saurabh Netravalkar.

<b>mammoth stand finally ends!</b> And Gumbie's luck finally runs out. He charges down the track to smash Kenjige over midwicket but runs past a good length ball on sixth stump and Monank takes the bails off.
Drinks taken at the fall of the wicket. USA might regret taking that wicket. Because all it means is that Sikandar Raza is coming to the middle. Zimbabwe are a good shot to make 375 from here, especially since USA is without their two best bowling options, who are also their two best death bowling options, Ali Khan and Saurabh Netravalkar.

Two slips in place. Here's Mark Adair. <b>9.00am </b> Seems a bright morning in Harare.

There is rain forecast. <B> 8.30am </b> Greetings to you all! Welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live ball-by-ball coverage of Ireland's tour of Zimbabwe. After having overcome a 1-0 deficit to win the T20Is, Ireland are brimming with confidence as we now switch over to the 50-overs format. On the surface, there's little to play for, given ODI cricket isn't top priority for most sides at the moment - given the T20 World Cup is coming up in six months - but for these two sides, any opportunity to prove their mettle on the big stage is a massive one, irrespective of what the calendar looks like. Both sides missed out on qualifying for the 50-over World Cup in India. Without the Super League, we already know the road to 2027 is that much more tougher for the smaller teams. And it'll be a rankings-based qualification criteria which makes every game these guys play massively important. So sit back, relax and enjoy what we hope will be an engaging contest in Harare. I'm Shashank Kishore. With me is Hemant Brar and P Ranjith. Look forward to your company for the rest of the day.

<strong>9.13am</strong> Thanks, Shashwat. Here come the two Zimbabwe openers, Joylord Gumbie and Tinashe Kamunhukamwe. The Ireland fielders are also making their way. Mark Adair will start things off for Ireland from over the wicket. Two slips in place. Can he find some early swing? Gumbie to take strike <strong>9:10am</strong> Two changes for Zimbabwe and they will hope to put up a better batting display. There will be help on offer early for the pacers and that might keep the Ireland bowlers interested. How will this first passage of play pan out? Here is Ashish to take you through the action. <strong>Zimbabwe XI:</strong> Joylord Gumbie, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe, Milton Shumba, Sikandar Raza (c), Ryan Burl, Clive Madande (wk), Brandon Mavuta, Tanaka Chivanga, Wellington Masakadza, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava <strong>Ireland XI:</strong> Paul Stirling (c), Andy Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker (wk), George Dockrell, Andy McBrine, Mark Adair, Graham Hume, Craig Young, Josh Little <strong>9:05am</strong> Time for the toss. Paul Stirling calls heads but it comes down as tails. <strong>Zimbabwe will bat first.</strong> Sikandar Raza says the pitch looks dry and he wants to change that mentality of just chasing by putting runs on the board. Stirling reckons he would have bowled first anyway and that suits the eleven they have fielded. Expects the track to play similarly to how it did on Wednesday. Let's see what the pitch has in store for us. The outfield, despite the rain, is expected to be quick. Seems a good batting wicket but there could be some assistance for the seamers when the ball is new. There is a bare patch, although that should not be too much of a worry. <strong>9am</strong> The sun is shining and it is a pleasant morning in Harare. Blue skies, as things stand, and that is vastly different to how it was a couple of days ago. <strong>8:30am</strong> ICYMI, the first match between these two teams was washed out. 25.3 overs of play was possible, though, and here is <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ireland-in-zimbabwe-2023-24-1408099/zimbabwe-vs-ireland-1st-odi-1408106/match-report">Hemant Brar recounting all the action</a> before rain played spoilsport. <strong>8:10am</strong> A couple of days ago, Ireland had Zimbabwe reeling, reducing them to 121-6 after 25.3 overs. But then, the rain arrived and it never relented, allowing Zimbabwe a get-out-of-jail card, and turning this three-match series into a two-game shootout. The second instalment is slated for today, and while the threat of rain still remains, there is the intrigue of how Zimbabwe will bounce back, having put up a meek batting display on Wednesday and having lost the T20I series to Ireland too. As for Ireland, it is about producing more of the same and gaining more white-ball experience on foreign lands ahead of the T20 World Cup next year. There are, of course, areas that they need to address too but these two remaining fixtures, provided the rain stays away, gives them ample opportunity to do so. All that and much more - including, possibly, some rain watch - as both sides try taking an unassailable lead in this series today, and hope to accumulate valuable ranking points that might decide their 2027 ODI World Cup fate… Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the second ODI between Ireland and Zimbabwe.

<strong>9.17am</strong> Joylord Gumbie and Tinashe Kamunhukamwe stride out. Mark Adair has the new ball! <strong>9.12am</strong> Thanks Aaditya! The teams are out for the anthems, and we should be on soon. It looks sunny and clear right now and hopefully it stays that way! Can Zimbabwe put on a better show with the bat than the first two games? We will know soon! <b>9:10am</b>: For a batting lineup which has just not put enough runs on the board so far in the series, Burl is a huge miss. Kaia and Kaitano both come in and have a big responsibility on their shoulders. Raza hasn't had a good series himself, but today's another opportunity to change that. With that, I'll hand over to Abhimanyu, who'll take you through the first part of the Zimbabwe innings. <b>9:05am</b>: Paul Stirling says Little picked up a little niggle in the last game, which is why he misses out today, with the left-arm spinner van Woerkom. For Zimbabwe meanwhile, Ryan Burl misses out due to concussion protocols, while Richard Ngarava isn't playing due to a groin injury. <b>Playing XIs:</b> <b>Zimbabwe:</b> 1. Joylord Gumbie (wk) 2. Tinashe Kamunhukamwe 3. Takudzwanashe Kaitano 4. Sikandar Raza (capt) 5. Innocent Kaia 6. Clive Madande 7. Brandon Mavuta 8. Luke Jongwe 9. Wellington Masakadza 10. Blessing Muzarabani 11.

Craig Young 11. Theo van Woerkom <b>8:50am: Ireland have won the toss and will bowl first.</b> They make one change, as Josh Little makes way for Theo van Woerkom. Zimbabwe have a few changes in their playing XI as Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Innocent Kaia and Luke Jongwe make their way back into the side. <b>8:40am</b>: Just a couple of minutes to toss time at the Harare Sports Club. Ireland should be happy with their combination thus far in the series, having dominated the first ODI before the rain as well. What changes, if any, do Zimbabwe make to their batting lineup? Also, for those wondering, <b>the weather seems to be bright and clear for the moment in Harare, but some rain is expected later in the afternoon</b>. <b>8:20am</b>: Last time out, Josh Little notched up the best ODI bowling figures for Ireland with his 6/36 restricting Zimbabwe to 166, before Curtis Campher's 66 took Ireland to a four-wicket win. Can the hosts come back and put up a better show with the bat today? Hello and welcome to our coverage of Ireland's last match on what has so far been a successful tour of Zimbabwe. They can't lose this series anyway, being 1-0 up, but a win today would make it wins in both the T20I and ODI series, which would be a great result for them after a tough few months in 2023. I'm Aaditya Narayan, and will be joined later by Abhimanyu Bose, as we take you through all the action from this final clash of the tour.

<strong>9.17am</strong> Joylord Gumbie and Tinashe Kamunhukamwe stride out. Mark Adair has the new ball! <strong>9.12am</strong> Thanks Aaditya! The teams are out for the anthems, and we should be on soon. It looks sunny and clear right now and hopefully it stays that way! Can Zimbabwe put on a better show with the bat than the first two games? We will know soon! <b>9:10am</b>: For a batting lineup which has just not put enough runs on the board so far in the series, Burl is a huge miss. Kaia and Kaitano both come in and have a big responsibility on their shoulders. Raza hasn't had a good series himself, but today's another opportunity to change that. With that, I'll hand over to Abhimanyu, who'll take you through the first part of the Zimbabwe innings. <b>9:05am</b>: Paul Stirling says Little picked up a little niggle in the last game, which is why he misses out today, with the left-arm spinner van Woerkom. For Zimbabwe meanwhile, Ryan Burl misses out due to concussion protocols, while Richard Ngarava isn't playing due to a groin injury. <b>Playing XIs:</b> <b>Zimbabwe:</b> 1. Joylord Gumbie (wk) 2. Tinashe Kamunhukamwe 3. Takudzwanashe Kaitano 4. Sikandar Raza (capt) 5. Innocent Kaia 6. Clive Madande 7. Brandon Mavuta 8. Luke Jongwe 9. Wellington Masakadza 10. Blessing Muzarabani 11.

Craig Young 11. Theo van Woerkom <b>8:50am: Ireland have won the toss and will bowl first.</b> They make one change, as Josh Little makes way for Theo van Woerkom. Zimbabwe have a few changes in their playing XI as Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Innocent Kaia and Luke Jongwe make their way back into the side. <b>8:40am</b>: Just a couple of minutes to toss time at the Harare Sports Club. Ireland should be happy with their combination thus far in the series, having dominated the first ODI before the rain as well. What changes, if any, do Zimbabwe make to their batting lineup? Also, for those wondering, <b>the weather seems to be bright and clear for the moment in Harare, but some rain is expected later in the afternoon</b>. <b>8:20am</b>: Last time out, Josh Little notched up the best ODI bowling figures for Ireland with his 6/36 restricting Zimbabwe to 166, before Curtis Campher's 66 took Ireland to a four-wicket win. Can the hosts come back and put up a better show with the bat today? Hello and welcome to our coverage of Ireland's last match on what has so far been a successful tour of Zimbabwe. They can't lose this series anyway, being 1-0 up, but a win today would make it wins in both the T20I and ODI series, which would be a great result for them after a tough few months in 2023. I'm Aaditya Narayan, and will be joined later by Abhimanyu Bose, as we take you through all the action from this final clash of the tour.

Conor: "I'm super confused with Zimbabwe's selections. I thought they had made progress by picking Brian Bennett and Tony Munyonga for the T20's, but then they drop Bennett and don't play Munyonga, instead favouring batsmen who have performed poorly internationally and have little upside (not even mentioning Nick Welch or Jono Campbell, who are both seemingly ignored by the selectors). You'd think they'd start backing some of the young, talented batters going forward instead of the same failed players?"

length ball on off stump, Gumbie drives down the ground past Campher. He looks for the quick single but Raza was diving back trying to prevent a possible run out at the non-striker's end. He can't get up in time for them to pick up a run.

<strong>ahh, Ervine escapes!</strong> Sri Lanka miss a run-out opportunity! Nissanka at square leg had a lot of time to aim for and throw at the non-striker's end, but still missed. There was no one to take the throw either. Length ball on middle from Chameera which Gumbie nudged to square leg, and sent Ervine back after initially coming down for an attempted single.

Ervine and debutant Gumbie to open the innings for Zimbabwe. Shoriful to start the proceedings with the new ball. Slip in place Jasim: "Best wishes to BD team. They should retain the winning streak in home ground." They lost the last T20I series they played at home against Sri Lanka. Bpagur : "BD and Zim has been "mutual recovery mates" over the past years. Looking forward to this series." <strong>Zimbabwe XI:</strong> Sikandar Raza (c), Craig Ervine, Joylord Gumbie, Brian Bennet, Sean Williams, Clive Mandande (wk), Luke Jongwe, Wellington Masakadza, Ryan Burl, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava Joylord Gumbie, who played ODIs, is making his T20I debut <strong>Bangladesh XI:</strong> Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Litton Kumer Das, Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Tawhid Hridoy, Md. Mahmudullah, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Rishad Hossain, Jaker Ali Anik (wk), Md Shaif Uddin Najmul Hossain Shanto: "It looks like a fresh wicket. We are expecting seam and swing early. They did really well in the last couple of matches, along with Mahedi Hasan." <strong>Toss:</strong> Bangladesh won the toss and elected to <strong>bowl </strong>first. <strong>Weather update:</strong> It is slightly cloudy in Chattogram at the moment, with forecast of a shower around 8pm local time. <strong>News from the ground:</strong> Tanzid Hasan has been handed his T20I cap by Mahmudullah before the toss. Zimbabwe, too, will be trying to recover from their humiliating defeat in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Africa Region Qualifiers, as well as their consecutive series losses against Sri Lanka and Ireland. They will be trying to repeat the same success again, having won the most recent bilateral series at Zimbabwe in 2022 against Bangladesh. However, they haven't won a white ball series in Bangladesh since 2001, so it will be challenging. Their greatest benefit will be having the captain back from the middle of the current IPL season; Sikandar is accustomed to Bangladesh. Therefore, the team will be counting on him to play to the best of his abilities and for everyone else to chip in and work as a unit. After losing the home series against Sri Lanka, Bangladesh will be trying to make the most of their home advantage and win back.They could strengthen their T20I world cup preparation with this series. After this Zimbabwe series, there will be another one against the USA in Texas, USA, beginning on May 21. For the first three games of the series, they will be without seasoned players like Mustafizur Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan. The substitute players will have a fantastic chance to perform well and display their skills at the greatest level. <strong>5.05 pm local time:</strong> Hello everyone! Welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of Zimbabwe vs. Bangladesh in the opening T20I match at Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram.

Marumani and Gumbie to start the innings, Shoriful with the new ball. Mizbah: "@Arnob I guess Liton wont be dropped from T20 WC squad if he failed here. " Mjhashim: "Who is this Johnathan Campbell , Alaistar Campbell son ? What a opening batsman he was back then when India Plays more game with Zimbabwe back in 1997-2001s " Yes, he is the son of Alistair Campbell. Shraif Omar: "What are the weather forecast? Will we have a complete match?" There's some rain in the forecast, but we can get the full match done IMHO Naim Noor Arnob: "Litton Das is living on this ice here. He is terribly out of form but selectors have kept their faith on him. He has to deliver in this series or else he might miss out on the t20 world cup as few other openers have lined up. " The visitors made three changes. They have handed a T20I debut to Jonathan Campbell and brought on Ainsley Ndlovu. They have dropped Sean Williams while Wellington Masakadza, who sustained a blow to his head in the first T20I, is out. Ryan Burl makes way for Tadiwanashe Marumani. <strong>Zimbabwe XI:</strong> 1 Joylord Gumbie (wk), 2 Craig Ervine, 3 Brian Bennett, 4 Sikandar Raza (c), 5 Clive Madande, 6 Jonathan Campbell, 7 Ryan Burl, 8 Like Jongwe, 9 Ainsley Ndlovu, 10 Richard Ngarava, 11 Blessing Muzarabani Bangladesh are unchanged. <strong>Bangladesh XI:</strong> Bangladesh: 1 Tanzid Hasan, 2 Litton Das, 3 Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), 4 Towhid Hridoy, 5 Mahmudullah, 6 Jaker Ali (wk), 7 Mahedi Hasan, 8 Rishad Hossain, 9 Mohammad Saifuddin, 10 Taskin Ahmed, 11 Shoriful Islam <strong>Toss update:</strong> Bangladesh won the toss and elected to <strong>bowl </strong>first Bpagur: "The challenge for BD is to maintain the momentum at different stages of the match, crucial for their WC matches. On the other hand, Zim will play without any pressure. This will make the 2nd t20 more interesting today." Bangladesh's outstanding bowling unit's performance won the opening game of the series, and Tanzid's 67* as a debutant made the job even simpler for them. In addition to trying to win the game and grab a 2-0 lead in the series today, they will be seeking to replicate the same performance once more. After losing miserably to the home team in all three units during the first game, Zimbabwe will be hoping for an entirely fresh start. They had an impressive start to the batting innings before a disastrous collapse. Later on, they had a respectable total to compete with because of the record stand between Madande and Masakadza. However, Zimbabwe faltered once more in the second innings after taking Litton Kumar's wicket. They bowled inconsistently and dropped three catches of Tanzid Tamim. <strong>5.10 pm local time:</strong> Greetings to all of you!
