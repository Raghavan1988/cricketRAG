I'm Peter Della Penna and I'll be joined throughout the day by Ashish Pant on commentary. At face value, most people would not assume these two countries would be heated rivals, especially based on the geographic locations of the two separating them by thousands of miles and the two governments having very cordial relationships. But ever since these two sides met for the first time on the cricket field in 2008 at ICC World Cricket League Division Five in Jersey, the contests between USA and Nepal have been spicy to say the least. From 2008 through 2014, the names in the rivalry featured names like Steve Messiah, Usman Shuja and Sushil Nadkarni for USA taking on Nepal stalwarts like Paras Khadka, Gyanendra Malla, Shakti "THE POWER" Gauchan and Basant Regmi as both teams fought their way up the World Cricket League ladder trying to attain ODI status. In the last five years, now that both sides have achieved ODI status, the names and faces have changed with USA featuring the likes of Steven Taylor, Monank Patel and Ali Khan while Nepal's new generation is being propelled by the likes of Rohit Paudel, Kushal Malla, Dipendra Singh Airee, Karan KC, Sompal Kami and the legspinner Sandeep Lamichhane. Nepal humiliated USA in Kathmandu in February 2020, bowling USA out for 35. The two sides then played an epic tied ODI in Texas in June 2022 when USA stumbled in the final over unable to secure the winning run with back-to-back wickets on the final two balls leaving scores level at 274. If USA wins today, they'll have to do it without fast bowler Ali Khan, who is serving the final game of a two-match suspension due to demerit point accumulation after a code of conduct breach against Jersey at the ICC CWC Qualifier Playoff in April. Nepal meanwhile may be without pace bowling allrounder Sompal Kami, who is struggling with a fitness issue.

Logan van Beek will take the new ball for the Netherlands. Modani and Taylor will open the batting for USA. These first few overs could be crucial, if the early stages of this tournament is anything to go by. <strong>8.58 am</strong> The anthems are done. The players are walking out to the middle. Time for me to hand over commentary controls to Shashwat Kumar. <strong>8.31 am</strong> Toss time! The word from the middle at Takashinga is that <strong>Netherlands have won the toss and unsurprisingly chosen to field first. </strong> USA captain Monank Patel, who missed the Nepal match while struck down with illness on Tuesday, is still not 100% fit and will sit out again. Aaron Jones is continuing to serve as stand-in captain. Ali Khan returns to the starting XI as expected in place of Kyle Phillip. <strong>USA XI: </strong>1 Steven Taylor, 2 Sushant Modani, 3 Sai Mukkamalla, 4 Aaron Jones (capt.), 5 Gajanand Singh, 6 Shayan Jahangir (wk), 7 Nisarg Patel, 8 Jessy Singh, 9 Nosthush Kenjige, 10 Ali Khan, 11 Saurabh Netravalkar. Netherlands have also made one change. Ryan Klein enters the lineup in place of Saqib Zufliqar. <strong>Netherlands XI: </strong>1 Vikramjit Singh, 2 Max O'Dowd, 3 Wesley Barresi, 4 Scott Edwards (capt./wk), 5 Bas de Leede, 6 Teja Nidamanuru, 7 Logan van Beek, 8 Clayton Floyd, 9 Shariz Ahmad, 10 Aryan Dutt, 11 Ryan Klein. <strong>8.15 am</strong> Good morning and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live ball-by-ball coverage of match day three in Group A at the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Harare, Zimbabwe as USA take on the Netherlands at Takashinga Sports Club. I'm Peter Della Penna and I'll be joined throughout the day on commentary by Shashwat Kumar. Both teams remain in pursuit of their first win of the tournament entering today's match. USA have lost to West Indies and Nepal to begin Group A while Netherlands lost their only match to Zimbabwe after having a bye on the opening day of fixtures. USA will get a boost today with the return of Ali Khan after he had to sit out the first two matches to serve an ICC suspension as a result of demerit point accumulation from code of conduct breaches. That's the good news. The bad news is that a stomach bug has been working its way through the USA squad and the word from the ground in Harare is the several players may be affected yet again today with illness, putting their availability in jeopardy. Nisarg Patel missed the opening match while USA captain Monank Patel never left his hotel room on Tuesday and had to follow USA's loss to Nepal remotely. As for the Netherlands, they haven't had suspension or illness affect their group in Zimbabwe. However, they are the team most severely affected by the  players <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/world-cup-qualifier-2023-associate-players-are-picking-county-over-world-cup-qualifier-and-why-shouldn-t-they-1381249">forced to choose County over Country. </a> It means that first-choice Dutch players such as Paul van Meekeren, Colin Ackermann, Brandon Glover, Timm van der Gugten and Roelof van der Merwe are all missing out.
