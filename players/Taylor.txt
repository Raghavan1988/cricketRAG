<strong>8.59 am.</strong> Anthems done. Players out in the middle. Rajbanshi will start with new ball left-arm spin. Taylor on strike for USA. Slip in place. <strong>8.31 am Toss time!</strong> Big news before the coin is even flipped by Rohit Paudel. <strong>Aaron Jones, the USA vice-captain is out in the middle. It appears that Monank Patel is unfit today and will miss out this crucial contest.</strong> Jones calls heads and it lands tails. <strong>Nepal will bowl first. </strong> Paudel confirms that Sompal Kami will miss today's game injured, and possibly the rest of the group stage after splitting the webbing with a hand injury trying to stop a return drive from Craig Ervine in the loss against Zimbabwe. Jones says that Monank Patel is not injured but rather missing out today due to illness and hopefully will be back for the next match, before saying USA's batters have to be careful of the early morning moisture in the pitch. Left-arm spinning allrounder Nisarg Patel is the player who comes into the USA XI in place of Monank. As for Sompal Kami, Nepal have decided to go with left-arm spinner Lalit Rajbanshi in his place. <strong>Nepal XI:</strong> 1 Kushal Bhurtel, 2 Aasif Sheikh (wk), 3 Kushal Malla, 4 Rohit Paddel (capt.), 5 Aarif Sheikh, 6 Gulshan Jha, 7 Dipendra Singh Airee, 8 Bhim Sharki, 9 Karan KC, 10 Sandeep Lamichhane, 11 Lalt Rajbanshi. <strong>USA XI:</strong> 1 Steven Taylor, 2 Sushant Modani, 3 Aaron Jones (capt.), 4 Sai Mukkamalla, 5 Gajanand Singh, 6 Shayan Jahangir (wk), 7 Nisarg Patel, 8 Jessy Singh, 9 Nosthush Kenjige, 10 Kyle Phillip, 11 Saurabh Netravalkar. So with Monank Patel out, Shayan Jahangir will take the gloves today for USA. Reminder for those in the USA that you can watch this match <a href="https://www.espn.com/espnplus/player/_/id/08af40b1-c5fb-4965-9ace-876b53f58e9e">on ESPN+</a>. <strong>8.10 am</strong> Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of today's Group A clash at the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier from Takashinga in Harare as Nepal takes on USA. I'm Peter Della Penna and I'll be joined throughout the day by Ashish Pant on commentary. At face value, most people would not assume these two countries would be heated rivals, especially based on the geographic locations of the two separating them by thousands of miles and the two governments having very cordial relationships. But ever since these two sides met for the first time on the cricket field in 2008 at ICC World Cricket League Division Five in Jersey, the contests between USA and Nepal have been spicy to say the least. From 2008 through 2014, the names in the rivalry featured names like Steve Messiah, Usman Shuja and Sushil Nadkarni for USA taking on Nepal stalwarts like Paras Khadka, Gyanendra Malla, Shakti "THE POWER" Gauchan and Basant Regmi as both teams fought their way up the World Cricket League ladder trying to attain ODI status. In the last five years, now that both sides have achieved ODI status, the names and faces have changed with USA featuring the likes of Steven Taylor, Monank Patel and Ali Khan while Nepal's new generation is being propelled by the likes of Rohit Paudel, Kushal Malla, Dipendra Singh Airee, Karan KC, Sompal Kami and the legspinner Sandeep Lamichhane. Nepal humiliated USA in Kathmandu in February 2020, bowling USA out for 35. The two sides then played an epic tied ODI in Texas in June 2022 when USA stumbled in the final over unable to secure the winning run with back-to-back wickets on the final two balls leaving scores level at 274. If USA wins today, they'll have to do it without fast bowler Ali Khan, who is serving the final game of a two-match suspension due to demerit point accumulation after a code of conduct breach against Jersey at the ICC CWC Qualifier Playoff in April. Nepal meanwhile may be without pace bowling allrounder Sompal Kami, who is struggling with a fitness issue.

The appeal goes up from Karan KC and umpire Ahmed Shah Pakteen from Afghanistan sends Taylor on his way. Assuming the trajectory on a full toss though, it may be a fair call.

<strong>9am</strong> How's it going, everyone? Logan van Beek will take the new ball for the Netherlands. Modani and Taylor will open the batting for USA. These first few overs could be crucial, if the early stages of this tournament is anything to go by. <strong>8.58 am</strong> The anthems are done. The players are walking out to the middle. Time for me to hand over commentary controls to Shashwat Kumar. <strong>8.31 am</strong> Toss time! The word from the middle at Takashinga is that <strong>Netherlands have won the toss and unsurprisingly chosen to field first. </strong> USA captain Monank Patel, who missed the Nepal match while struck down with illness on Tuesday, is still not 100% fit and will sit out again. Aaron Jones is continuing to serve as stand-in captain. Ali Khan returns to the starting XI as expected in place of Kyle Phillip. <strong>USA XI: </strong>1 Steven Taylor, 2 Sushant Modani, 3 Sai Mukkamalla, 4 Aaron Jones (capt.), 5 Gajanand Singh, 6 Shayan Jahangir (wk), 7 Nisarg Patel, 8 Jessy Singh, 9 Nosthush Kenjige, 10 Ali Khan, 11 Saurabh Netravalkar. Netherlands have also made one change. Ryan Klein enters the lineup in place of Saqib Zufliqar. <strong>Netherlands XI: </strong>1 Vikramjit Singh, 2 Max O'Dowd, 3 Wesley Barresi, 4 Scott Edwards (capt./wk), 5 Bas de Leede, 6 Teja Nidamanuru, 7 Logan van Beek, 8 Clayton Floyd, 9 Shariz Ahmad, 10 Aryan Dutt, 11 Ryan Klein. <strong>8.15 am</strong> Good morning and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live ball-by-ball coverage of match day three in Group A at the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Harare, Zimbabwe as USA take on the Netherlands at Takashinga Sports Club. I'm Peter Della Penna and I'll be joined throughout the day on commentary by Shashwat Kumar. Both teams remain in pursuit of their first win of the tournament entering today's match. USA have lost to West Indies and Nepal to begin Group A while Netherlands lost their only match to Zimbabwe after having a bye on the opening day of fixtures. USA will get a boost today with the return of Ali Khan after he had to sit out the first two matches to serve an ICC suspension as a result of demerit point accumulation from code of conduct breaches. That's the good news. The bad news is that a stomach bug has been working its way through the USA squad and the word from the ground in Harare is the several players may be affected yet again today with illness, putting their availability in jeopardy. Nisarg Patel missed the opening match while USA captain Monank Patel never left his hotel room on Tuesday and had to follow USA's loss to Nepal remotely. As for the Netherlands, they haven't had suspension or illness affect their group in Zimbabwe. However, they are the team most severely affected by the  players <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/world-cup-qualifier-2023-associate-players-are-picking-county-over-world-cup-qualifier-and-why-shouldn-t-they-1381249">forced to choose County over Country. </a> It means that first-choice Dutch players such as Paul van Meekeren, Colin Ackermann, Brandon Glover, Timm van der Gugten and Roelof van der Merwe are all missing out. However, their replacements filled in very admirably against Zimbabwe and so nobody can take them lightly, least of all USA who remain winless.

Steven Taylor b van Beek 10 (19b 2x4 0x6 21m) SR: 52.63
<strong>van Beek gets Taylor with an absolute ripper!</strong> Back of a length delivery that seems to start just outside off stump before curving back devilishly. Taylor's feet go nowhere and he has a stab at it, more in hope than anything else. Before his bat comes down, though, the ball breezes through and flattens off stump!

Starts off the proceedings with a probing stuff and delivers a maiden! This one jagged back viciously and rapped him on the pads, a bit too high and the umpire is not on the same page as the bowler
Thank you, Peter. Sean Williams scored a big-daddy hundred and was severe on the hapless United States bowlers. Sikandar Raza is in red-hot form and once again was seen striking effortlessly while Ryan Burl made a quickfire 47 off 16 deliveries that helped put up this seemingly impregnable score on the board. USA couldn't stop the haemorrhaging of runs as they ran into a side which is becoming a juggernaut at home. Players are making their way out in the middle. Zimbabwe will launch an all-out attack with this massive total to defend

<strong>12.13pm</strong> Thanks, Danyal. What do you guys think at the halfway stage? Advantage South Africa? The pitch has been excellent for batting. Remember USA chased down a similar score in their opening game of the World Cup. Can they do it again? Out come the South Africa fielders with Aiden Markram leading the pep talk. Steven Taylor and Andries Gous, the two USA openers, also stride out. Marco Jansen has the new ball. He is coming over the wicket. Two slips in place Here's Mel: There's a real mix of fans in the stadium today. I can see flags and shirts for Bangladesh, NZ, South Africa, Wales (!), India and yes, even Pakistan.
