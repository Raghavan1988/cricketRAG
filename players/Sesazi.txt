Simon Ssesazi c Fazalhaq Farooqi b Mujeeb Ur Rahman 4 (4b 1x4 0x6 9m) SR: 100
<strong>Mujeeb in on the act now!</strong> Plenty of revs on this one, and this is bowled on a length outside off. Ssesazi looks for the sweep but the over-spin on the ball means that it bounces extra. Spoons up off the top edge and Farooqi completes the easiest of catches at short fine leg!

fired in fuller and quicker on leg stump. Ssesazi has a slog across the line and seems to miss it. Pings off the back leg into the off side

Simon Ssesazi c Joseph b Shepherd 4 (3b 1x4 0x6 6m) SR: 133.33
<strong>soft dismissal!</strong> Fullish just outside off and buoyed by the last ball, Ssesazi goes after this. Plants his front foot and swipes at it but the extra pace and bounce means he cloths it. Easy catch for Joseph at mid on, and Uganda are two down early!

<strong>big appeal, and given! That looks very plumb!</strong> Another yorker, which starts on middle and leg and curves away. Ssesazi has no clue about it and is awfully late in jamming his bat down. Sneaks past the inside edge and hits him flush on the back leg, right in front of middle stump. Ssesazi does not bother with the review, and Uganda lose their first!
