<strong>1:29pm</strong> Shafali and Mandhana stride out, followed by the South African fielders. Mandhana to take strike. There is a slip in place as Khaka takes the new ball - here we go!

<strong>Mandhana is very very lucky to still be batting after that!</strong> She is too early into her flick and gets a leading edge that pops back up invitingly for the bowler, but de Klerk slips in her follow through and can't quite get it. Then there's confusion in the running between the wickets, and Mandhana is halfway down before she gets sent back by Kaur. Eventually, she makes her ground safely.
And that will be drinks. It's come at a good time for Mandhana, who was getting a bit itchy after having managed just five runs off her last 10 balls.
