a big shot and a rare success for Sri Lanka in this powerplay. This was full on the pads, and Kamindu plays a pick up shot over square leg, makes an excellent connection , and gets a one-bounce four. High risk shot, but Sri Lanka need boundaries desperately

Shot: DEFENDED

<strong>beauty!</strong> This is almost a test-match delivery, length ball, just seaming away, beating the left-hander's outside edge as he attempts to defend.

Kamindu Mendis is gone! They just can't get power into these shotst. This was length on the stumps, that Kamindu gets across and tries to flick over square leg. Doesn't clear the boundary though. Doesn't even get close. The fielder there takes a simple catch, about 10 metres in from the rope. He was hitting ot the longer side.
