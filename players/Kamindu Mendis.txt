<strong>11:05pm</strong> Sri Lanka are all smiles as they pose with the winner's trophy. That also brings us to the end of our coverage for this game and the series. Hope you enjoyed it just as much as we loved bringing it to you. Until next time, this is goodbye from me (Shashwat), Ranjith and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care, folks! <b>Wanindu Hasaranga, the Sri Lanka captain is also the Player of the Series:</b> We played good cricket in the first two games. Credit goes to our bowlers and the batters. (On the players who came in today) We just wanted to see how they perform and that is why we made four changes. <b>Ibrahim Zadran, Afghanistan captain:</b> I am happy with the win. Unfortunately, we lost the series. Feeling great after the game today. (On the score) It was a good total we put up on the board. Hazrat and Gurbaz gave us good momentum and we wanted to carry it through. (On the changes they made) We wanted to give chances to the players who did not play. We are going to the T20 World Cup and we wanted to try out players. If you look at the first game, we played well but could not win, and we won today. We have lots of positives to take (from this series) and take it into the T20 World Cup. <b>Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Player of the Match:</b> (How pleasing was his innings today) To be honest, it was (quite pleasing). It was a really hard time for me, I had not scored (before in the series). I was under pressure but I tried to go in today and play my natural game. I took responsibility and I think that was the reason. (On what he prefers - chasing or batting first) I don't mind. Whenever I have a good day, I can chase and set a total. I hope we learn from the mistakes we did here and I hope we don't repeat it moving forward. It's time for the presentation ceremony. <strong>10:40pm</strong> Phew, what a game of cricket that was. And, rather ironically, it might be remembered for the number of wides Sri Lanka bowled, and the one No ball that Afghanistan got away with in the final over. Coming back to the run-chase, Sri Lanka began like a house on fire, with Nissanka setting the tone. Mendis and Perera fell around him but he kept at it. In fact, it was not until he tweaked his hamstring that Sri Lanka began losing grip of the chase. A middle-order wobble was arrested by Samarawickrama and Mendis, although the former departed just when Sri Lanka needed him to up the ante further. Mendis, to his credit, kept Sri Lanka afloat, receving fleeting moments of support from Shanaka and Dananjaya (given he finished with four off one ball). It all came down to the last over, and Mendis just could not find the fence enough number of times to take Sri Lanka past the finish line. As for Afghanistan, Nabi was the pick of their bowlers again. He gave away 35 runs and accounted for Hasaranga and Mathews. Noor was not bad either, and Qais, coming in as a concussion sub, played his part, getting rid of Samarawickrama. Afghanistan did drop a couple of chances but on this particular occasion, it did not come back to haunt them.

<strong>oh my!</strong> A very high full toss on middle and off. Takes Mendis by surprise and he swings at it in vain. Everyone looks at the square leg umpire immediately but he is unmoved. That looked high to the naked eye, and replays confirm it was way above the waist. Almost a chest-high full toss. Mendis did take a step down the track but that was still too high.

right in the slot just outside off. Mendis sits deep in his crease and heaves it towards deep backward square leg

11 off 3. Another boundary here, and Afghanistan will really feel the pinch. Short fine leg moves finer

<strong>oh my!</strong> A very high full toss on middle and off. Takes Mendis by surprise and he swings at it in vain. Everyone looks at the square leg umpire immediately but he is unmoved. That looked high to the naked eye, and replays confirm it was way above the waist. Almost a chest-high full toss. Mendis did take a step down the track but that was still too high. Afghanistan have gotten away with one here

low full toss just outside leg. Mendis swipes across the line and misses. Gets pinged on the back leg but surely the impact was outside leg? <strong>Afghanistan have reviewed nonetheless. More in hope, I suspect. Nothing on UltraEdge but as expected, the impact was outside leg. Mendis survives but it is a dot ball!</strong>

What a game this has been already. Just six balls remain. <strong>SL need 19.</strong> Anything lesser than 18 scored this over, and Afghanistan will win. Momand to bowl the final over. <strong>Only four fielders outside the ring</strong> because Afghanistan are behind the over-rate

<strong>oh dear, a misfield!</strong> Length on leg stump. Mendis swings for the hills and shanks it off the inside edge. Races away towards short fine leg, where Janat produces an inexplicable misfield, and lets it go through his hands!

mix-up and Kamindu is out, thanks to some cool work from Mahedi Hasan at point. Kamindu doesn't read Rishad's googly and the ball goes off the outside edge toward point. Both batters take off immediately, but Kamindu stutters when he sees the fielder is close to the ball, and ends up being stranded mid-pitch as Sadeera races to the strikers' end. Seeing Kamindu so far out of his ground, Mahedi sends in a gentle-enough throw to Rishad for the bowler to collect and break the stumps with plenty of time.
