OUT! {"short": "run out", "long": "run out (Markram)", "commentary": "Scott Edwards run out (Markram) 10 (9b 0x4 1x6 8m) SR: 111.11"}
a run-out opportunity at the non-striker's end! <b>Great agility by Markram</b>, and he finds Edwards short! Markram was placed a few steps close in at mid-on, and went low and dived forward to have a go at the stumps. He hit the top of the stumps, and found a diving Edwards clearly short. Edwards had earlier pushed a length ball towards mid-on with his bottom hand off
