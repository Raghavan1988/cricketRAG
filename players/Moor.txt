good take by the keeper, as he dives to his left full stretch to stop a certain four. Masood bowled on a length on leg, and got it to angle down further as Moor hardly shaped to clip

Masood has the new ball for Afghanistan. Moor on strike for Ireland, with three slips and a gully. Sam: "Strong start with the ball but have the Irish gone in a batter light here with Campher at 3 and Adair at 7? Six bowlers seems excessive..." --- I'd assume selection for both teams might have to do with the unknown nature of the pitch, so they must have gone either with their strength or with their gut feel <strong>3.02pm</strong> Welcome for the Ireland innings. They have an entire session to bat on the first day after their bowlers did the job in the morning and afternoon. If the ball keeps swinging as much as did for Ireland, then Afghanistan could hit back and end the day with the game in balance. <hr>

driven to deep backward point! He drives at this full delivery just outside off, and beats the man at point to his left to get rolling first ball

another confident for lbw, and this time it is given out. Now <strong>Moor reviews</strong>. The third umpire being kept busy. On a length on middle and off from Naveed again, and this one keeps lower than what Moor thought. He went to clip, with the ball hitting him just about on his knee on what seems like leg stump. And replays show no inside edge, and also that the ball would have headed down the leg side. So Moor survives again

<strong>bowled him!</strong> Naveed strikes again, as both of Ireland's openers are gone. The ball hit the off stump, as Moor almost squatted to try and push at that. But, but... <b>it is a no-ball</b>, so Moor gets a life. Replays show Naveed barely crossed the line, so Afghanistan let another chance go. Anyway, the ball angled back in rather sharply after pitching considerably outside off, as Moor looked to push forward but was beaten

<strong>chopped on!</strong> Naveed begins his celebrations again, and this time they will be for real. Moor is walking back, and it is not a no-ball too. He looked to ride the bounce of this short-of-a-length delivery outside off which was shaping back in. It almost cramped him for room, and he got into an awkward position in looking to flash it, eventually getting a bottom edge on to middle stump
