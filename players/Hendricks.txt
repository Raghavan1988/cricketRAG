Especially with so many active at such odd hours! anonymous : "just said got headache and left from the work just to catch this match but don't say to anyone " <strong>7pm</strong> It's toss time! <b>Nepal win the toss and bowl first.</b> Nepal skipper Rohit Paudel says they are expecting dew in the second innings, which is why they want to chase. About their long break between matches, Paudel says it was a good opportunity for them to train. South Africa captain Aiden Markram says he would have batted first as well, and he hopes the batters get some time in the middle. <strong>South Africa:</strong> 1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Reeza Hendricks, 3 Aiden Markram (capt), 4 Tristan Stubbs, 5 Heinrich Klaasen, 6 David Miller, 7 Marco Jansen, 8 Tabraiz Shamsi, 9 Kagiso Rabada, 10 Ottneil Baartman, 11 Anrich Nortje <strong>Nepal:</strong> 1 Kushal Bhurtel, 2 Aasif Sheikh (wk), 3 Anil Sah, 4 Rohit Paudel (Capt), 5 Kushal Malla, 6 Dipendra Singh Airee, 7 Sompal Kami, 8 Gulshan Jha, 9 Karan KC, 10 Sandeep Lamichhane, 11 Abinash Bohara Rabin karki: "Staying awake at 1.30 am here in Germany,hope this night creates magic and history". Did Germany's stunning win to start off Euro 2024 help you keep awake? Abhishek Upadhy: "Good evening from rainy New York. Glad that the match is taking place in a dry caribbean location. :DLet's go Nepal!!!" &agrave;&curren: "Due to heavy rainfall here in hilly areas of nepal , no electricity , no internet still waked up early just to scroll scores here and support our Country Nepal .Good luck " <b>6.50pm</b> Devesh Pradhan: "Good morning from Kathmandu, Nepal.... Its a weekend.... 4:30 AM...... Birds starting to chirp along with Nepal cricket team fans...." Well, Nepal fans have also been chirpy in the World Cup, or at least they were in the USA leg of the tournament, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/2024-t20-world-cup-is-it-kathmandu-or-dallas-nepal-s-american-population-shows-its-strength-at-the-world-cup-1438635">writes Cameron Ponsonby</a>. Jack Dyer: "How is Lamichhane allowed to play when he wasn't in Nepal's original squad? Is one of Nepal's other players 'injured'?" Nepal had only named 14 players in their original squad, a smart move that allowed them to add Lamichhane once the action moved out of the USA. <strong>6.45pm</strong> Will spin play a big role today? And will South Africa's top order get some much needed runs and form going into the Super Eights? Firdose Moonda has covered these and other big questions in her <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/nepal-vs-south-africa-31st-match-group-d-1415731/match-preview">preview</a>. "As a Nepali and also a big fan of South Africa, in a dilemma which team to support today. Perhaps, one over Nepal and one over South Africa. But please don't tell my friends." My lips are sealed, Shiva Bhusal. Bhim : "First thing first, How is the weather?. Rain victim  Nepal fan who couldnot watch match in Florida and got plane ticket canceled next day." It's a little cloudy, but there is no rain predicted, as of now, so hopefully we should get uninterrupted action. Prakash Gautam_: "As a Nepalese cricket fan,  I would be delighted if Nepal shows resilience, regardless of the match outcome." <strong>6.40pm</strong> Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of today's match between South Africa and Nepal in Kingstown, St. Vincent. South Africa have already qualified, but will look to finish the group stage strong with four wins from four games, while Nepal will look to get among the upsets, especially with legspinner Sandeep Lamichhane available for the first time in the tournament. I'm Abhimanyu and I'll be bringing you all the action alongside Madushka Balasuriya today.
