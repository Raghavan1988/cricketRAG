Siraj founds the stumps at the non-striker's end. We go upstairs. Siraj did deserve to send Hendricks back after those first two overs. Another big shot attempted, inside edge to mid-on, Markram calls him through, but he is caught short by Siraj;'s direct hit

that's the end of that. <strong>It's a series win for this young Indian team.</strong> Avesh bowls a slower length ball outside off. Hendricks is looking to walk across to scoop but has no pace to work with, ends up lobbing one in the air off the thick edge and Sanju takes an easy catch at short third.
That's the presentation wrapped up. As KL & co celebrate, this is Shashank Kishore saying goodbye on behalf of Sreshth Shah and P Ranjith. Look forward to your company on Boxing Day for the Test series. Merry christmas everyone. Enjoy the holiday season. Stay safe. <b> KL Rahul: </b> Love being around the boys, that's how it's been since I came over to South Africa after some time away following a disappointing World Cup final. Pleased for Sanju, he's been a phenomenal performer in the IPL over the years. Unfortunately we haven't been able to give him the chance at No. 3, because obviously there are stalwarts in the ODIs who occupy those key spots. Glad he was able to grab his chances here. Will celebrate with the boys and then switch back to focusing on the Test series in a day or two. <b> Arshdeep Singh is the Player of the Series for his 10 wickets.</b> "The plan was simple, it was to bowl wicket-to-wicket and get lbws and bowled. Sometimes when there isn't anything happening on the wicket, you need some support from the umpires, that's why I had to appeal a lot (laughs). IPL has been a very good platform for us youngsters, there isn't a big gap between IPL and international cricket. You understand the mindset of international cricketers and it helps. We are all loving the chances we've got. We'd love to give our all in the future as well and do well." <b> Sanju Samson is the Player of the Match for his maiden ODI century. </b> "Proud of it, specially considering the result as well. Have been working hard. This format gives you some extra time to understand the wicket and the bowler's mindset. Batting at the top of the order gives you those 10-20 extra deliveries. The whole country is very proud of how Tilak Verma has stepped up, lot more expected from him. The seniors have set the standards of Indian cricket and the juniors are coming in and doing the job. It's not very easy, traveling in between and playing every 2-3 days but they're getting the job done." <b> Aiden Makram: </b> Unfortunately we couldn't get it done. We were good in patches, just couldn't stitch the momentum up in our favour for long enough. The surface didn't change much throughout the game, thought 290 was chaseable. Not sure the toss played a major factor today. The Test series is very exciting, two great venues for two Test matches in South Africa, doesn't get much better than that. Sohum T: "Arshdeep with the best bowling average and bowling economy for India in 3rd ODI. He should be the player of the series." <b>8.50pm </b> From 141 for 2, South Africa have collapsed to 218 all out. It all started with Markram's ill-advised reverse sweep that led to the collapse. That was the opening India need to open up an inch into an acre. The fast bowlers, led by Arshdeep Singh, stepped up from there on to close out the game superbly. Arshdeep found able support from Avesh, but the real game-changer with the ball was Washington Sundar, whose spell in the middle (10-0-38-2) proved to be a massive difference. As well as India did with the ball, the credit for laying the foundation of the win must go to Sanju Samson, who struck his maiden international century. Quite a sweet turnaround for KL Rahul who presided over a 3-0 sweep by South Africa the last time he led India here in an ODI series. Comes back nearly two years later and leads India to a 2-1 series win.

Reeza Hendricks lbw b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 4m) SR: 0
just half an appeal for lbw, and given out! A deafening roar from the Bangladesh supporters shakes New York up. Sakib angled this in and bowled on a length on off. The ball just about hinted to straighten away, as Hendricks defended on middle stump. But he was hit on his back leg, with the ball also seemingly staying a little low. A first-ball duck for Hendricks

Thanks, Srinidhi. Gops asks "Haven't watched the second innings. Are the WI quicks exploiting the variable bounce? Has Shamar bowled any cutters?" Quicks did use sideways movement well. Spinners have been on for a bit now, they've been a bit on and off. Shamar's scrambled the seam often, not sure if he bowled slow <hr> Over to Ekanth again

Thanks, Srinidhi. Gops asks "Haven't watched the second innings. Are the WI quicks exploiting the variable bounce? Has Shamar bowled any cutters?" Quicks did use sideways movement well. Spinners have been on for a bit now, they've been a bit on and off. Shamar's scrambled the seam often, not sure if he bowled slow <hr> Over to Ekanth again

got him! Chase strikes too. He bowled full and flat on middle, seeing Hendricks get across the stumps early. The latter went for the sweep presumably behind square, but was beaten because it seemed like a quicker and a seam-up delivery from Chase. The ball went on to hit the middle stump

c Motie b Joseph
Reeza Hendricks c Motie b Joseph 6 (6b 1x4 0x6 6m) SR: 100
ballooned to mid-on! Motie there had to move a few steps behind to take that, though. Joseph bangs this on the shorter side of a length in the channel outside off, and the ball bounces up rather considerably. Hendricks goes for the pull, but the pace and bounce means he gets it off the higher side of the bat for a simple catch for Motie
