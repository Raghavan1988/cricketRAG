<b>slog-swept into the ropes!</b> Stokes presses out and smacks the ball hard and flat through midwicket, lands one last blow before <b>tea</b>. I thought they started the session 5 minutes late but they are going in on time, with India feeling much better about things
<b>2.15pm:</b> Another rollicking session, the highlights being Zak Crawley's 76 and a dazzling double-strike from Jasprit Bumrah. England were pressing the accelerator at 114 for 1 and Crawley in his pomp but lost 3 for 22 in five overs; Axar Patel with the initial breakthrough before Bumrah ripped out the heart of England's batting order with a precision spell of reverse swing. As in the India innings, players have got in and got out - and Yashasvi Jaiswal's monument to concentration is currently the difference. In short, cracking stuff. Sid will be back for more in 10
