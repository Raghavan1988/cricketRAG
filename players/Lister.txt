Wrecked the stumps! Yorker machine does it again, round the wicket angle, spears in a magnificent yorker, angled in lulling him into a false sense of security before moving it away and demolishes him with a searing yorker, New Zealand are bowled out on a paltry score of 90 which should be a walk in the park task for Pakistan
New Zealand are well short of a par score and Pakistan were clinical with the ball. Everybody chipped in and gave no respite to the batters. It was a tough task for New Zealand to contend with a full-strength Pakistan team, and so far, the contest has been one-way traffic. New Zealand will need wickets in clusters to stay alive in the contest. Be back soon for the chase Fawad: "You have to ask.. why did u drop Amir? I wonder how much of a difference it would have made if it was amir representing pak in odi wc in india instead of haris or even hasan ali or usama mir. You have wonder!" aariz: "I feel like Amir and Shaheen opening would have been better. For Shaheen, He just needs to be confident in bowling hard. I saw his opening spell and I think he reached around 140 a few times but if he bowled as hard as he did in PSL, he would be able to extract even 145 in his opening spell." Shahid : "Complete and perfect bowling attack with the addition of imad waseem it will be Complete team and ideal bowling attack!"
