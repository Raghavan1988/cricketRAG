<strong>Dropped by Bennett!</strong> Full-toss ball on the fifth stump, smashes it straight to long off and Bennett drops a sitter!
After losing three wickets in 15 runs, Bangladesh's top order misfired once more, putting them in serious jeopardy. Although captain Shanto and Riyad began to fix the innings, Shanto departed after scoring a steady innings of 36. Zimbabwe lost momentum in the middle of the innings after failing to build on their strong start. In T20Is, Riyad achieved his eighth fifty well-executed. Later, Jaker Ali put Bangladesh over the 150-mark with a blistering 24 off 11 balls. Both Bennett and Muzarabani picked up two wickets. After a little interval, come join us for the second innings. <strong>Zimbabwe requires 158 runs to win the match</strong>
