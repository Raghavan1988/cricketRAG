fuller length, 125kph, he drives and gets a thick inside edge that runs behind square
Rahul Malnad : "Last time these two teams played an ODI game here in this stadium was 11 years ago. Pollard got a magnificent century despite WI's shaky start. But Australia eventually went on to win the match thanks to Watson's 76. Interestingly, the late Phil Hughes played this match, scoring 23 off 43.
