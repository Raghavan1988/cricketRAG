<strong>WI are collapsing but low bounce this sharp isn't too bad a sign</strong>. This scooted off a length and, luckily for Hosein, the line was around fifth stump. So being bowled wasn't a threat after it went below the back-foot straight punch. Eventually beat QDK too

<strong>Another shooter gets a wicket</strong>. Not much Hosein could've done there, especially after going on the back foot to a fullish length ball that was jagging back at 134ks. He was deep in the crease and was swindled by the low bounce. Looked like the wobble ball. Lots of similarities to a Stuart Broad delivery

bowls from around the stumps, and bowls it full and wide outside off. It's the cutter as well and the left-handed Hosein gets an outside edge to the keeper
