<strong>appeal, not given!</strong> Back of a length on middle and leg. Grips and spins into Malla. He plays all around it and gets rapped on the pads but that might have been heading down leg with the turn. Replays indicate the ball would have clipped the top of leg stump, and it would have returned Umpire's Call had Bangladesh gone upstairs

<strong>goes through everything!</strong> Tossed up wonderfully on a full length outside off. Malla looks for the drive but watches in disbelief as the ball rips past the inside edge. Litton does not read it either and Nepal get two extras

<strong>almost a run-out!</strong> Shortish outside off. Malla cuts it towards backward point. Airee wants the single but is sent back by his ball-watching partner. Airee has to bring out the dive and might have still been in trouble had Mahmudullah gathered and taken off the bails

Nepal need 42 off 30. They needed a lot fewer against SA and had more wickets in hand too. Can they turn things around tonight? Mahmudullah to bowl the 16th. Around the wicket to Malla

back of a length on off. Malla goes back and stabs it towards short mid wicket, who puts in a dive to his right and stops the single

<strong>goes straight up, and Shanto holds on!</strong> Excellently-disguised cutter on a back of a length just outside off. Malla looks to go downtown but the lack of pace does for him. Shanks it and Shanto, running back from mid off, gobbles up a smart chance in front of his face. This is a massive moment in the game!
