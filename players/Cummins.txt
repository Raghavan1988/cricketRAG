There wasn't much happening for him to bowl like that and get the wicket of Smith, get us back into the game. He kept on going until he was cramping. [De Kock] Outstanding tournament.

And the big two up front were incredible. [Head] Has this knack of finding a wicket. Been different bowlers chip in through the whole tournament. [Inglis] Played that beautifully. He looked in control against two really good spinners on a tough wicket. The good thing is a few of us have been there for finals before.

Perhaps Temba Bavuma will always wonder whether he should have opted to bowl, but his team fought magnificently from 24 for 4. David Miller's hundred meant Australia would have to chase something in the "tricky" range on a turning pitch, and South Africa bit back again after Travis Head's aggression had cut the requirement in half. In the end, 212 was just too few on the board (despite the echoes of 1999). Australia march on into their eighth World Cup final, where they will take on India in a replay of the 2003 showpiece
