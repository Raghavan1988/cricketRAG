full and straight, pinned in front! Not given by Kettleborough, and Coetzee can't believe it, he's already signalling for a review! Bavuma does go to the DRS... did it pitch in line? That's the only question from this angle. And there's the answer: landed about six inches outside leg stump! CALM DOWN, EVERYONE

<b>short and wide and steered for the winning runs!</b> Postman Pat delivers! Cummins gets the job done, Australia win by three wickets and will play India in Ahmedabad on Sunday
<b>10.35pm:</b> It's been another low-scoring bunfight between South Africa and Australia, but you-know-who are in the final again. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/australia-vs-south-africa-2nd-semi-final-1384438/match-report>Alagappan Muthu's report</a> is already up and running, then stick around for much more in the way of analysis, colour and reaction from our team at the ground. Australia are on their way to Ahmedabad for a rematch of their tournament opener against India, and so are we (in spirit at least). Should be a classic. From myself, Gnasher, Thilak and the rest, it's goodbye for now. Let's do it all again on Sunday, shall we? Bye! <b>10.25pm:</b> Time to hear from the captains, starting with <b>Temba Bavuma</b>: "Quite hard to put into word. Congrats to Australia, all the best for them in the final. They were outstanding for a large part of the game and thoroughly deserved victory. [Fight] Our character came through. It was a dog fight. The way we started with the bat and the ball was probably the turning point, we lost it quite badly there. [Top-order collapse] Conditions and the quality of the attack. They were ruthless. Presented with the conditions but they really put us under pressure. [Klaasen dismissal] We were gaining momentum at that point, we've seen how destructive he can be in the latter part of the innings. David Miller showed what he can do as a player and his mentality. Would have liked to have bowled better, it allowed the other batters to play themselves in. Shamsi was terrific, we were competitive but we needed a lot to go right. We had chances - tough chances - but we put them down. Could have been more proactive but you need things to go your way. [Coetzee] As a young guy he was a warrior. There wasn't much happening for him to bowl like that and get the wicket of Smith, get us back into the game. He kept on going until he was cramping. [De Kock] Outstanding tournament. Would have wanted to end on a different note, but he'll remember the fight we showed as a team. We've enjoyed playing with him, in SA he will go down as a legend of the game." And Australia's <b>Pat Cummins</b>: "Easier than sitting in the dugout. Nerve-wracking couple of hours but great effort and a great game. We thought it would spin quite a bit. Wasn't expecting Starcy and Josh to bowl so much early. [Lost toss] Bit gloomy, swinging around so wasn't too upset. [Fielding] Something we talk a lot about. Wasn't up to scratch at the start of the tournament. Davey, 37, diving around, incredible. And the big two up front were incredible. [Head] Has this knack of finding a wicket. Been different bowlers chip in through the whole tournament. [Inglis] Played that beautifully. He looked in control against two really good spinners on a tough wicket. The good thing is a few of us have been there for finals before. Got to embrace it, the stadium is going to be packed, pretty one-sided but got to embrace it. The 2015 World Cup was a career highlight, so to be out there in a final in India, can't wait." <b>Travis Head</b> is named Player of the Match: "Hard to unpack all of that. Tense finish, amazing game. [Surface] We knew how it was going to play. Having had three or four days here, you go to bed and think about it. The wickets have been unbelievable, haven't seen much spin but we knew it was going to be a grind. [Broken hand] Thought I wasn't going to be here, just want to contribute for Australia. [Klaasen ball] Straight as they come. I was under the pump, not sure how it got through. Seeing the wicket, was prepared to bowl a few overs. Always keen. [Attack with bat] We've had that positive approach, trying to get ahead of the rate. Disappointed to get out how I did, that's the match-up for me but it wasn't to be. [India] Unbelievable attack. Never dreamed of being in a World Cup final against the team of the comp so far." <b>10.10pm:</b> More knockout heartbreak for South Africa, although they showed tremendous heart to take this game right down to the wire. Perhaps Temba Bavuma will always wonder whether he should have opted to bowl, but his team fought magnificently from 24 for 4. David Miller's hundred meant Australia would have to chase something in the "tricky" range on a turning pitch, and South Africa bit back again after Travis Head's aggression had cut the requirement in half. In the end, 212 was just too few on the board (despite the echoes of 1999). Australia march on into their eighth World Cup final, where they will take on India in a replay of the 2003 showpiece
