Shanaka is OUT! caught
c †Gumbie b Sikandar Raza
Dasun Shanaka c †Gumbie b Sikandar Raza 7 (13b 0x4 0x6 16m) SR: 53.84
Raza and Gumbie are celebrating without caring about or even looking at the umpire. Shanaka has edged behind to Gumbie. Raza bowled it short and around fifth stump, releasing it from back of the hand and getting it to turn away. Shanaka looked to slash at that, but got an edge behind, which Gumbie did well to take pretty high, considering the bounce off the surface

excellent from Litton, who does a behind-the-back flick to run a diving Shanaka out. Shanaka had mis-hit this short ball towards long on, and is trying to run back for another two. But although the throw comes in wide of off stump, Litton collects cleanly, and without having time to look finds the one stump available to him. Shanaka is well short.
So Bangladesh will have 175  to chase. Given the ease of their last chase here, they might back themselves. But they have Wanindu Hasaranga to contend with on this occasion, of course. I'll be back with Bangladesh's reply shortly
