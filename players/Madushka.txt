<b>4.24pm</b> Okay Masood to Madushka. Rajiv: "Are you referring to which Madushka? Madushka Balasuriya or Nishan Madushka... lol Anyway, both will step in for the start of Sri Lanka's dig with the bat."  -_- Usman: "Is the overrate in this match slow? Or England is pacing up more than usual? " --- Nope, it's been pretty slow overall in Colombo. 25 overs in both the first and second sessions. Happens when you have three seamers in play. Nicole De Niese: "Nissan or Balasuriya? Either way Madushkas will be stepping up all over the place..." --- Already get my fill when Madushanka plays. If Nishan Madushka ends up having a long career, feel like my commentary stints are going to become quite groundhog day-ish. <B>4.20pm</b> Welcome back folks, we should be underway with the Sri Lankan innings shortly. A little over an hour's play left you imagine, what will the approach be from the openers? Nishan Madushka certainly has an aggressive streak in him, but there will still be something there for the seamers. Intriguing passage of play ahead.

Thanks Shashwat. Madushka in comms and Madushka to take first strike as well. Shoriful Islam with the ball. And with that, it is time for me to hand over controls to Madushka for the first time today. Galib: "Was it a good decision made by the Bangladesh captain? I have seen Bangladesh to struggle many times in the fourth innings. " -- Bangladesh's thinking would be to make the most of whatever moisture is there in the surface, and before a ball has been bowled, that seems the right call. Rafail : "Nearly  4 am in the UK, Woke up to watch some spicy test cricket. Bangladesh looks solid with 3 quicks and a couple of decent spin options." <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> The sun is breaking through and it finally feels nice, says Russel Arnold. There was lots of water on the covers but it is bone-dry now. There is an even covering of grass, and he expects the ball to come onto the bat and for there to be pace and bounce. Cracks are there too and they might widen as the game progresses, making batting difficult later in the match. Arnold adds that it is a good Test pitch but the key will be application. <strong>9:50am</strong> Bangladesh have also handed a debut to Nahid Rana, who bowls at a rapid pace and clocked 149.7 kph during the recently concluded season of the Bangladesh Premier League.

Opening the batting will be Nishan Madushka alongside Dimuth Karunaratne. Khaled Ahmed, one of just two pacers in the side, to take the new ball. Thanks Shashwat, good toss to win then for the Sri Lankans. What are we thinking is a good first innings score folks? <strong>9:57am</strong> Just a few minutes to go before the first ball. Here is Madushka to take you through the first hour. Riyad_Shuvo: "Mark my words: Shakib is a champion, he will take 10 wickets and score a century to commemorate his test return " <b>Chris Silverwood, Sri Lanka head coach:</b> A happy camp after the last match but we have to do it again this week. We had a couple of days off, one of which was a travel day. Boys have trained really hard (ahead of this game). Looking at the history here, they being high-scoring games, it is going to be tough. But a good chance for the batters to put runs in front of their names, and a good opportunity to show off their skills. Last game, we saw two individuals score heavily for us. We held on to our lengths (with the ball) for long periods and that paid off. <b>Nic Pothas, standing in as head coach for Bangladesh:</b> When you are one down, there is more incentive. But you have to concentrate when the ball is coming down, and not worry about the end result. When you don't have someone like Mushy (Mushfiqur Rahim) or Shakib, it makes a difference. Having Shakib back does make a difference. Mood in the camp is great, it is always great. Our guys are very much on-task, being level and treating each game as it comes. Not worried about the past. <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> Hot and humid, and that is not a surprise, says Russel Arnold. A very different surface, with there being not much grass, although it does look hard. The stems and roots are visible and that might lead to abrasiveness. There are a few cracks and the pitch might crumble later on, with the spinners coming into play definitely, and this playing out as a proper sub-continental track. CharithD: "@Shashwat : What are the changes for BD ?" -- Mahmud and Shakib have come in for Nahid Rana and Shoriful Islam. Saleque Sufi : "It is a desperate do or die match for Bangladesh for avoiding a series white wash at home. Bangladesh is far better balanced with Shakib Al Hasan back in the team. Bangladesh has superior spin attack and may be hard nut to crack. On batting friendly and spin favouring wicket will not be surprised if Bangladesh score a win against Sri Lanka." -- That said, Sri Lanka have never lost a Test to Bangladesh in Bangladesh... <strong>9:40am</strong> A debut for Hasan Mahmud, and he is one of only two pacers Bangladesh are playing, alongside Khaled. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have stuck to the same balance, with Asitha replacing Rajitha. Sri Lanka, with de Silva and Kamindu also capable of bowling spin, do have six bowling options in total (seven if Mathews decides to turn his arm over). <strong>Bangladesh XI:</strong> Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Zakir Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Shahadat Hossain, Litton Das (wk), Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam, Khaled Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud <strong>Sri Lanka XI:</strong> Dimuth Karunaratne, Nishan Madushka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya de Silva (c), Kamindu Mendis, Prabath Jayasuriya, Asitha Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando <strong>9:30am</strong> <strong>Sri Lanka have won the toss and they have opted to bat first. </strong> <b>9:20am</b> <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/asitha-fernando-to-replace-injured-kasun-rajitha-for-chattogram-test-1426667">Sri Lanka will be without Rajitha</a>, who picked up eight wickets in Sylhet. Asitha Fernando, his replacement, does have fond memories of playing Bangladesh in Bangladesh, though. Speaking of the hosts, they will be without head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe, who has travelled back to Australia for personal reasons, with <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ban-vs-sl-nic-pothas-in-charge-of-bangladesh-for-second-test-as-chandika-hathurusinghe-goes-on-leave-1426647">assistant coach Nic Pothas taking over for this game.</a> Bangladesh, though, will be <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shakib-al-hasan-named-in-test-squad-for-chattogram-vs-sri-lanka-1426409">welcoming back Shakib Al Hasan</a>, which should bolster them significantly. <b>8:55am</b> Ten and a half sessions of Test cricket in Sylhet yielded a 328-run win for Sri Lanka, which saw them assert their authority on the series. Captain Dhananjaya de Silva was at the forefront, supported all along the way by Kamindu Mendis, who was playing just his second Test. Apart from <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ban-vs-sl-stats-all-kamindu-mendis-and-dhananjaya-de-silva-twinning-records-1426126">breaking multiple records</a>, the pair put the game well beyond Bangladesh.

Opening the batting will be Nishan Madushka alongside Dimuth Karunaratne. Khaled Ahmed, one of just two pacers in the side, to take the new ball. Thanks Shashwat, good toss to win then for the Sri Lankans. What are we thinking is a good first innings score folks? <strong>9:57am</strong> Just a few minutes to go before the first ball. Here is Madushka to take you through the first hour. Riyad_Shuvo: "Mark my words: Shakib is a champion, he will take 10 wickets and score a century to commemorate his test return " <b>Chris Silverwood, Sri Lanka head coach:</b> A happy camp after the last match but we have to do it again this week. We had a couple of days off, one of which was a travel day. Boys have trained really hard (ahead of this game). Looking at the history here, they being high-scoring games, it is going to be tough. But a good chance for the batters to put runs in front of their names, and a good opportunity to show off their skills. Last game, we saw two individuals score heavily for us. We held on to our lengths (with the ball) for long periods and that paid off. <b>Nic Pothas, standing in as head coach for Bangladesh:</b> When you are one down, there is more incentive. But you have to concentrate when the ball is coming down, and not worry about the end result. When you don't have someone like Mushy (Mushfiqur Rahim) or Shakib, it makes a difference. Having Shakib back does make a difference. Mood in the camp is great, it is always great. Our guys are very much on-task, being level and treating each game as it comes. Not worried about the past. <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> Hot and humid, and that is not a surprise, says Russel Arnold. A very different surface, with there being not much grass, although it does look hard. The stems and roots are visible and that might lead to abrasiveness. There are a few cracks and the pitch might crumble later on, with the spinners coming into play definitely, and this playing out as a proper sub-continental track. CharithD: "@Shashwat : What are the changes for BD ?" -- Mahmud and Shakib have come in for Nahid Rana and Shoriful Islam. Saleque Sufi : "It is a desperate do or die match for Bangladesh for avoiding a series white wash at home. Bangladesh is far better balanced with Shakib Al Hasan back in the team. Bangladesh has superior spin attack and may be hard nut to crack. On batting friendly and spin favouring wicket will not be surprised if Bangladesh score a win against Sri Lanka." -- That said, Sri Lanka have never lost a Test to Bangladesh in Bangladesh... <strong>9:40am</strong> A debut for Hasan Mahmud, and he is one of only two pacers Bangladesh are playing, alongside Khaled. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have stuck to the same balance, with Asitha replacing Rajitha. Sri Lanka, with de Silva and Kamindu also capable of bowling spin, do have six bowling options in total (seven if Mathews decides to turn his arm over). <strong>Bangladesh XI:</strong> Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Zakir Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Shahadat Hossain, Litton Das (wk), Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam, Khaled Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud <strong>Sri Lanka XI:</strong> Dimuth Karunaratne, Nishan Madushka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya de Silva (c), Kamindu Mendis, Prabath Jayasuriya, Asitha Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Vishwa Fernando <strong>9:30am</strong> <strong>Sri Lanka have won the toss and they have opted to bat first. </strong> <b>9:20am</b> <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/asitha-fernando-to-replace-injured-kasun-rajitha-for-chattogram-test-1426667">Sri Lanka will be without Rajitha</a>, who picked up eight wickets in Sylhet. Asitha Fernando, his replacement, does have fond memories of playing Bangladesh in Bangladesh, though. Speaking of the hosts, they will be without head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe, who has travelled back to Australia for personal reasons, with <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ban-vs-sl-nic-pothas-in-charge-of-bangladesh-for-second-test-as-chandika-hathurusinghe-goes-on-leave-1426647">assistant coach Nic Pothas taking over for this game.</a> Bangladesh, though, will be <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shakib-al-hasan-named-in-test-squad-for-chattogram-vs-sri-lanka-1426409">welcoming back Shakib Al Hasan</a>, which should bolster them significantly. <b>8:55am</b> Ten and a half sessions of Test cricket in Sylhet yielded a 328-run win for Sri Lanka, which saw them assert their authority on the series. Captain Dhananjaya de Silva was at the forefront, supported all along the way by Kamindu Mendis, who was playing just his second Test. Apart from <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ban-vs-sl-stats-all-kamindu-mendis-and-dhananjaya-de-silva-twinning-records-1426126">breaking multiple records</a>, the pair put the game well beyond Bangladesh.
