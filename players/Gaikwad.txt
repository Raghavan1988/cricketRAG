Nandre Burger has the first new ball. Two slips in place <strong>12.59pm</strong> Ruturaj Gaikwad and Sai Sudharsan charge out to open. South Africa are done with their huddle. All is in readiness for the chase. <strong>12.55pm</strong> Welcome back for the chase in what has turned out to be a pretty short Pink Day. There was plenty in the pitch even towards the end of South Africa's innings, but when the opposition knows they have only 117 to chase, they can plan accordingly. However, if South Africa can manage to make this a close contest, we are in for some entertainment. We should get underway in five minutes or so.

<strong>swing first up</strong>, appeal for lbw, but Gaikwad has got an inside edge on this

appeal for lbw as Gaikwad misses a full ball but this seems going down leg. Not given, and this time South Africa review. This is pretty full, on middle, and then seams in to go past the inside edge. It is full enough to not have moved too much. Ball tracking says it is hitting leg. The decision is overturned

lovely correction of length. Beats the inside edge, hits the pad, given, and Gaikwad reviews it. Just pulls the length back enough to deny him the drive. The ball swings past his inside edge, is pitching middle and leg, and hitting leg. India lose the review too

<strong>12.58pm</strong> The national anthems are done. Ruturaj Gaikwad and B Sai Sudharsan walk out to open for India. Nandre Burger has the first new ball. Two slips in place <strong>12.55pm</strong> Thanks Shashwat. Another beautiful South African venue. Aiden Markram seems to be relying on the Easterly wind, which is usually the bowling wind in Gqeberha. <strong>12:50pm</strong> About ten minutes to go before the first ball. South Africa will be hoping for some early wickets, having opted to field first. India, meanwhile, would want Gaikwad and Sudharsan to get them off to a decent start and not lose too many wickets. How do you think the early exchanges will pan out? Here is Sidharth Monga to take you through all the action. A bit about the pitch and the conditions now. A bit of breeze around. The square boundaries are slightly skewed, <strong>62m to one side and 70m to the other</strong>. The longest pocket is <strong>84m</strong>. There is a lot of grass on the surface and some cracks. A bit of uncertainty around how the ball will behave if it hits one of those cracks. Pommie Mbangwa says the <strong>average score might hover around 270</strong> and if the team batting first can get more than that, they will be well-placed. <strong>Tilak Varma:</strong> (How the tour has gone so far) Pretty well, enjoyed the last T20I series. We have prepared well for the ODIs and the first game was quite good for us. Now prepared for the second game. The last two months, we (Dewald Brevis and me) were talking about this series. Went to his home two days back and had a good time there. He is really talented and you can see him in the South Africa side real soon. (On batting conditions in SA) The wickets are two-paced. We thought there would be bounce but the last game, the ball seamed and it was stopping also. (On the ODI format) From childhood, we have been watching ODIs and World Cups, and have played a lot of one-day cricket also. <strong>India XI:</strong> Ruturaj Gaikwad, Sai Sudharsan, Tilak Varma, KL Rahul (c & wk), Sanju Samson, Rinku Singh, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Avesh Khan, Mukesh Kumar <strong>South Africa XI:</strong> Reeza Hendricks, Tony de Zorzi, Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram (c), Heinrich Klaasen (wk), David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Keshav Maharaj, Lizaad Williams, Nandre Burger, Beuran Hendricks <strong>12:31pm</strong> Markram and Rahul are out in the middle and are all smiles, alongside match referee Chris Broad. Markram gives it a flick. Rahul calls tails but it comes down as heads. <strong>South Africa will bowl first.</strong> Markram says it is a fresh wicket and that they want to make the most of the conditions with the new ball. Mentions the record SA have had while chasing in this format lately and reckons today is a good opportunity to rectify it. New game today, and they will try to put their best foot forward. Two changes for South Africa - Phehlukwayo and Shamsi are out - the former because of a side strain he picked up in the first ODI. Beuran Hendricks and Lizaad Williams have come in. Rahul says it looks like a good wicket, and hopes they can put up some runs on the board. Quick turnaround and adds that it is important to focus on today. Just one change for India - Shreyas is out and has been replaced by Rinku. <strong>12:28pm</strong> Not long left now before the toss. The pitches in Gqeberha have generally been sluggish, with the 300-run mark yet to be breached in an ODI innings. What should the captain winning the toss do? <strong>12:20pm</strong> News coming in from Gqeberha is that <strong>Rinku Singh has been handed his ODI cap.</strong> Kuldeep Yadav presented the left-handed middle order batter with his cap. <strong>12:15pm</strong> India will be forced into one change, with Shreyas Iyer leaving to join the Test side. Rajat Patidar and Rinku Singh are the two out-and-out batters who missed out in Johannesburg and could be in contention. Patidar bats predominantly in the top four, while Rinku has so far aced his finishing role in T20I cricket. Who do you think should get a go today? <strong>12:05pm</strong> South Africa were chastened on Sunday, and a failure to win today will lead to their fourth ODI series defeat at home since April 2021.

It was a nightmare for South Africa. They won the toss, batted first and were then bundled out for 116.

Arshdeep Singh and Avesh Khan were excellent, snapping up nine of the ten wickets that fell. Mukesh Kumar got the new ball to jag around and Sai Sudharsan, on ODI debut, registered a half-century.

And, it would illustrate that India, irrespective of the conditions, the opposition and the personnel, remain a force to be reckoned with. As for South Africa, well, the defeat on Sunday and the manner of it would have left a scar. Usually, such losses are not easy to bounce back from. To make it tougher, the Proteas have had all of one and a half days to recover. The flip side, though, is that because they have had such less time, they have perhaps avoided brooding over it too much. And because of how tepid they were on Sunday, maybe the only way possible now is upwards.

I am Shashwat Kumar and will soon be joined by Sidharth Monga, and we will take you through all the action that unfolds in Gqeberha.
