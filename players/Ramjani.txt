Alpesh Ramjani c Gulbadin Naib b Naveen-ul-Haq 0 (2b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0
<strong>edged and taken! Uganda are falling apart!</strong> Full outside off, tempting the poke away from the body. Ramjani falls into the temptation and does so with hard hands, meaning that the outside edge carries comfortably to Naib at slip. He gobbles it up and then does his trademark muscle-flexing celebration. Metaphorically too, Afghanistan are flexing their muscles, and they are overpowering Uganda!

Ramjani is the latest left-hander to try his luck with the bat

fullish just outside off. Ramjani is awfully late on the stroke and chops it on the bounce to slip

<strong>that is adjacent! As plumb as it gets!</strong> Darted in on a length on middle and off. Ramjani gets down on one knee and hacks across the line. Swishes at fresh air and the ball pins him on the back leg, right in front of middle. That might have been missing leg stump and off stump....because that was crashing into middle!

<strong>Southee goes up, and so does Paul Reiffel's finger!</strong> Length on middle and leg, and this seems to curve back in. Curves back in enough and keeps low to graze the pad and then hit the bat as Ramjani looks to defend. <strong>Ramjani has reviewed, and don't think he will get as much success as Ronak did in the last over. Clearly pad-first and Ball Tracking reckons it is missing leg stump because....it is thundering into the middle of middle stump!</strong>
