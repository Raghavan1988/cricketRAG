slog-sweep, under-edged through fine leg, and Shepherd and Forde leap in glee! West Indies win their first ODI series against England in the Caribbean for 25 years!
<B>10.30pm</B> And with that, Shai Hope heads across to claim the series trophy. A hugely proud moment for him and his team. After missing the World Cup, this is a very pleasing way to mark a new beginning. As for England, there's always the T20s... join us on Tuesday for the first of five pre-Christmas contests. From Miller, Alan, Vish, Thilak and the team, good night! <B>10.21pm</B> Time for some presentations. <B>Matthew Forde</B> is Player of the Match on debut. "A lot of work behind the scenes, training hard in the camp beforehand, this is a dream come true. Special for me, I thank all the guys for making it possible. In front of my home crowd, my mum and dad, it's heartwarming. The wicket was a bit tacky, a bit of seam movement, line and length, got some wickets, so thankful. Batting at the end with Sheppie, it was about turning over the strike, and getting him back on." <B>Jos Buttler</B>: "A few short with the bat, 40 for 5 really set us back. Rain was challenging but the guys are used to those breaks in concentration. A few mistakes with the bat. It's been wet so was a really good effort with the ball, the spinners brought us back into the game. It's the start of a long journey for these guys, hopefully we can build something for the future. Looking forward to the change of format, and a good T20 series against a good side." <B>Shai Hope</B>, also named Player of the Series: "We got the win, that's what I wanted at the outset. My run contributed so I'm happy. I stick to the basics, to benefit the team. A motivator for the batters, I'm setting a decent example but the others are chipping in to become a really good batting group. So much history in cricket, it's hard to keep up, but great to give some cheer for the West Indies fans. Forde was amazing, to be at the end there to seal the deal, he's going to be a great player." <B>10.11pm</B> Euphoria for West Indies, more food for thought for Jos Buttler and his beaten troops. The 2019 World Champions were dethroned last month, and their descent continues with a humbling 2-1 loss to a new-look Windies team. Keacy Carty and Alick Athanaze made the running in the chase, Romario Shepherd and Matthew Forde sealed the contest that their bowling had set up in the first place. England's spinners did a fine job to give their team a puncher's chance, but in the end, their own batting shortcomings couldn't be overcome.
