Forde was amazing, to be at the end there to seal the deal, he's going to be a great player." <B>10.11pm</B> Euphoria for West Indies, more food for thought for Jos Buttler and his beaten troops. The 2019 World Champions were dethroned last month, and their descent continues with a humbling 2-1 loss to a new-look Windies team. Keacy Carty and Alick Athanaze made the running in the chase, Romario Shepherd and Matthew Forde sealed the contest that their bowling had set up in the first place. England's spinners did a fine job to give their team a puncher's chance, but in the end, their own batting shortcomings couldn't be overcome.
