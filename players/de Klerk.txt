short of a length and wide outside, punched to extra cover.
The over didn't quite begin well for Deepti, but she has finished it in style with a wicket and two dots. South Africa now need 75 off 7 overs, and without Kapp in the middle, India will fancy their chances now.

Nadine de Klerk is the new batter

<strong>Two wickets in two, or is it?</strong> de Klerk misses the sweep and gets struck on her front pad. Seemed to be sliding down leg, <strong>but the umpire has given it out.</strong> de Klerk reviews straightaway, and that's because she <strong>got an inside edge on that one</strong>.

Vastrakar is on for the 48th Firoz: "I reckon, the chasing side losing after 2 hundreds is rarer than the side that batted first losing after 2 batsmen scoring hundreds" --- Well Firoz, it's never happened in women's cricket before, either chasing or batting first, that a side has lost after having two centurions in a game. So either way, we'll witness a bit of history here.

nails the yorker on leg stump, de Klerk gets an inside edge on to her pad after which it dribbles away into the offside. Wolvaardt's back in strike now

<strong>Another twist in the tale!</strong> De Klerk looks to finish it off with one blow as she looked to mow this length ball over long-on. Gets foxed a bit by the slower one and doesn't get the timing quite perfect. It falls right into Reddy's hands at long-on, and she makes no mistake.
