Appeal for stumping as Rinku is beaten on the reverse sweep again. Third umpire is called for. No bat or glove involved, so on we go. His foot was also grounded behind, so all fine. Was on a length outside off, he misses that shot for the second time this innings.

Back of a length ball outside off, he ramps it fine and Shamsi's valiant dive isn't enough. Rinku gets four and India reach 100 in 11 overs.
Prasanna S: "@ Srini - the problem is compounded badly by so many batsmen in top 6 can't bowl useful part timers. Even if India doesn't earth an all rounder overnight, we really need two batsmen who can bowl. Deepak Hooda was grooming up to be an answer to one of them, but lost form. We can groom Washi for that role, he has the game to be the no.7 Jaddu at 6 Washy at 7 and Axar at 8 seem to be the best options for the WC."

<strong>Has the reverse sweep got Rinku in trouble again?</strong> The umpire says yes, but Rinku has reviewed. Only some bat and glove can save him here, I feel. Yep, there's some glove, and that is why Rinku was quick to review. Was flatter and fuller on the stump. Rinku misses the reverse for a third time, and  is lucky to be out there

36 off the over including five sixes, a four and a no-ball. Rinku has ended it with 6, 6, 6. Janat goes short this time, but he is hitting everything clean now. Manages to clear deep square leg with the pull
<b>8.47pm</b> That's 103 runs from the last five overs. All others than these two scored single figures. These two tried everything but struggled because of the slowness of the pitch. And then Rohit targeted the debutant Saleem. And once it started coming off, the wheels came off for Afghanistan. A fifth T20I hundred for Rohit. Some innings, some fireworks. Shashank will be with you for the chase

slower ball, 111ks, but right in the slot. Rinku creates the power with his bat speed in the slog. Clears deep midwicket. Carnage

now Rinky brings up his fifty. Omarzai misses the yorker again, and you just can't bowl slot balls to these batters. Over long-off it goes
