<strong>what a beauty, and Mominul bites the dust!</strong> Back of a length delivery that seems destined to angle into middle and off. On pitching, though, it decks away and squares up Mominul completely. He dangles his bat and the ball flies off the outside edge towards third slip, where Kamindu Mendis snaffles it up. Bangladesh in all sorts of trouble now!

That's lunch folks. Fair to say Sri Lanka have dominated that second hour with Vishwa Fernando in-seamers uprooting the stumps of overnight batters Zakir Hasan and Taijul Islam, while Prabath Jayasuriya dismissed captain Shanto. Bangladesh will be desperate for a partnership when they come back after the break. Walker : "Are any of the Fernando's related to you Andrew? As far as you know of course !" Sadly, no. You could sneeze and hit three Fernandos in parts of the country. A very common surname. Shashwat will be back to take over after lunch.
