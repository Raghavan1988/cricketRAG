beats him on the inside, big appeal for lbw, Gaffaney shakes his head... and Stokes <b>reviews</b> at the last moment! The ball ended up in the hands of slip, so England might be having a bob each way here. Looked pretty adjacent on first glance, was there an inside edge? No, decides Marais Erasmus, over to ball-tracking... and it's clearing the stumps! It looked for all the world like Hartley was going to get a maiden Test wicket there, but his height (and bounce) has saved Gill
And England are all out of reviews in the 14th over!

"This is so predictable - I don't think anyone who follows red ball cricket really understood Hartley's selection ahead of Dawson. It seems to be purely because he's tall. Or is it a bit of arrogance with Stokes and Baz, thinking they can turn raw materials into world beaters on the strength of their vibes alone?" I think it was pragmatism, Martin - Dawson is currently playing in the SA20 and isn't centrally contracted. The way the world works now

beats him on the inside, big appeal for lbw, Gaffaney shakes his head... and Stokes <b>reviews</b> at the last moment! The ball ended up in the hands of slip, so England might be having a bob each way here. Looked pretty adjacent on first glance, was there an inside edge? No, decides Marais Erasmus, over to ball-tracking... and it's clearing the stumps! It looked for all the world like Hartley was going to get a maiden Test wicket there, but his height (and bounce) has saved Gill

<b>finds the edge again, and Foakes swallows this!</b> Gill worked over by Anderson in that short spell and now he's heading off. Fifth time he's fallen to England's veteran swinger. Searching line in the channel and it nibbled away to clip the bat, sizeable deflection that was heading between keeper and slip - but Foakes makes no mistake. Test wicket No. 691 for Anderson

Gorgeous three-quarter length ball on fourth. The last ball decked back in. This one went straight but Gill was a bit more cautious, tried defending relatively closer to the pad with a straight bat but could only feather the seam-up ball to Foakes. Wood bowling from wide of the crease. Ball tracking shows a little later that the previous ball seamed in 0.8 degrees and this one went away 0.6 degrees.

Gill is OUT! lbw

Shubman Gill lbw b Shoaib Bashir 38 (65b 6x4 0x6 91m) SR: 58.46
offspinner has got an lbw on the front-foot defensive. This is very rare. Gill has reviewed. It has to either be impacting outside off or missing leg. This is such a rare dismissal because it has turned in sharply to beat the inside edge and he is forward so if it has hit him in line, it has to be missing leg. Well almost. The replays show his front foot is half-cock, which means he hasn't entirely got outside the line. Umpire's call on impact. Well done, Bashir. Well done, umpire.
That wicket brings a drinks break. Andrew Miller with you on the other side of it
