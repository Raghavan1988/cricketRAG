Zakary Foulkes b Shaheen Shah Afridi 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0
<strong>Stumps askew! </strong>Demolishes him with a pinpoint accurate yorker from around the wicket and it's right in the blockhole, too good for thee. Two in two, Pakistan are in a strong position. He is so good at nailing those yorkers, it's a terrific option at this stage of the game. Foulkes attempted to flick that away to the leg side and imo should have just defended it with a straight bat
