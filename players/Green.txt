Full on off, Green strides forward to block the last ball of the day. <b>Australia finish on 59 for 2, trailing West Indies by 129</b>
<strong>5:31pm</strong> A good day of Test cricket this. Australia would be certainly happy with the way it played out but West Indies have had worse days in the sport and would not be too disappointed with how it has panned out so far. Their batting tanked. Only McKenzie showed some resistance with a maiden fifty before Shamar Joseph's attacking knock at the very end. But with the ball, they put in a spirited performance. It was once again led by Shamar Joseph, who dismissed both Smith - with his <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/wicket-with-first-ball-in-career-283520"><strong>first ball in Tests</strong></a> - and Labuschagne. <b>Josh Hazlewood</b>: "Their tail wagged and we needed work in the last wicket stand. The wicket was an interesting one, not much pace and bounce. The odd one nips around. I love playing here, whether it is the pink ball or red. You don't have to bowl too quick, just hang around the off stump. Greeny today, he made two tough catches look pretty easy. At gully, looks like he covers ten metres on either side of him. Hopefully we bat whole day tomorrow." <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/west-indies-in-australia-2023-24-1375837/australia-vs-west-indies-1st-test-1375845/match-report">Gnasher's match report</a> will have all the details up soon.
