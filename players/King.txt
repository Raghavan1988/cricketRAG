The co-hosts against a team that is in unchartered territory, both literally and metaphorically. On paper, this is a mismatch. Uganda, though, will have a crack at this, producing a performance likely soaked in bravery, courage and showcasing plenty of heart. Because…that is what they do. They were not favourites to be at this men's T20 World Cup, nor were many expecting them to <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/papua-new-guinea-vs-uganda-9th-match-group-c-1415709/full-scorecard">win at the second time of asking.</a> Yet, here they are, transcending dreams and reality. And with absolutely nothing to lose, who really knows how far they can still go. West Indies have much more to lose, both in an immediate tournament context and in terms of reputation. A win will take them <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/points-table-standings">level on points with Afghanistan</a> and will keep them in pole position to qualify. But if the improbable happens, the ghosts of 2021 and 2022 will gush back quickly, and the T20 World Cup they are co-hosting, which was supposed to a dream scenario, could morph into a nightmare just as swiftly. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of <b>Match 18 of the 2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. Uganda shook hands with paradise the other day and will be itching for a tighter embrace tonight, although they are up against the mighty West Indies, who'd be wanting to flex their muscles much more convincingly after the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/west-indies-vs-papua-new-guinea-2nd-match-group-c-1415702/full-scorecard">events on Sunday.</a> Hop on, this should be fun!

There is anticipation and expectation among those at the Brian Lara Stadium. The two-time champions will want to get off to a brisk start to give the crowd even more to cheer about. King and Charles to open the batting for the co-hosts. Boult with the new ball for the Kiwis - here we go! <strong>8:23pm</strong> The atmosphere at the venue is electric as both teams walk out for their respective national anthems. The New Zealand national anthem is up for, and will be followed by the West Indies' anthem. Neil: "NZ going in with 9 possible bowling options, 4 spinners in Santner, Phillips, Ravindra and Williamson, 5 seamers with Boult, Southee, Ferguson, Neesham and Mitchell" -- If NZ have to use that many, they'd likely be chasing a huge score... <b>Trent Boult:</b> (On the performance against Afghanistan) It was a long time ago. We had five or so days off, so plenty of time to review and understand where it went wrong. We were off the mark in all three facets and you cannot let that happen. (On the opposition) Needs no introduction tonight and we are looking forward to it. They are a dangerous side, they have eleven match-winners in their side. it is a great challenge and the boys cannot wait to get stuck in. This is a new venue for all of us really. Training has not been great. We were not able to train at the venue because the wickets were very, very friendly, as I would describe it. Trying to put on a better show than we did the other day. (On the lack of practice matches) The boys are coming off a winter. We could have played warm-up games. The draw has been unusual - we are into the second week, some teams have already qualified playing three (and we are playing just our second tonight). Not trying to make excuses but it has been pretty hard to get momentum from one game, but the boys are ready to get stuck in (tonight). <strong>8:15pm</strong> Plenty to dissect from the playing elevens. NZ have made three changes, which is slightly against what head coach Gary Stead hinted at prior to the game.
