Right, here we go. Moeen Ali to open the bowling again <b>1.25pm:</b> Hello folks, looks a lovely evening for it in St George's. Can England find their mojo or are they going to be swept away for the fifth time in six matches on this tour?

Will we see a change of tack today? <strong>1.11pm:</strong> Your reactions to that England XI: "Typical hopeless selections," says Peter. "Where the blazes is John Turner? Scared that he'll outdo Buttler's buddies?"

<strong>The King is gone!</strong> That's a gorgeous piece of bowling - flighted, slower too, asking to be heaved to the short side. King obliges, but goes high rather than far and straight into the hands of Siaka, who steadies himself at deep midwicket to take the catch. Now then!
And with that wicket, drinks are being taken. Deeptank: "Is it pitch or PNG bowlers are too good?" I'd say the PNG bowlers are doing what they need to in conditions that are there to be exploited... but West Indies are more than playing their part with some poor shots and, ultimately, a lack of strike rotation

King is OUT! caught
c Siaka b Vala
Brandon King c Siaka b Vala 34 (29b 7x4 0x6 44m) SR: 117.24
<strong>The King is gone!</strong> That's a gorgeous piece of bowling - flighted, slower too, asking to be heaved to the short side. King obliges, but goes high rather than far and straight into the hands of Siaka, who steadies himself at deep midwicket to take the catch. Now then!
And with that wicket, drinks are being taken. Deeptank: "Is it pitch or PNG bowlers are too good?" I'd say the PNG bowlers are doing what they need to in conditions that are there to be exploited... but West Indies are more than playing their part with some poor shots and, ultimately, a lack of strike rotation

<strong>8:27pm</strong> The West Indian national anthem is met with cheers and we are almost ready to go. The two-time champions would want a better batting display overall. Uganda could do with another tidy bowling performance. King and Charles to open the batting for WI. Ssesazi has the helmet on, which indicates Ramjani could get things underway.

Uganda's national anthem is up first and that will be followed by the West Indies' anthem. <strong>8:10pm</strong> So, a captain has finally decided to bat first.

Uganda have been a little shaky batting second too, and the West Indies will hope to put up a good total on the board, even as Uganda try to keep them down to something that makes their second innings easier.

<strong>8:27pm</strong> A rapturous applause greets the West Indian national anthem, sung by David Rudder. There is anticipation and expectation among those at the Brian Lara Stadium. The two-time champions will want to get off to a brisk start to give the crowd even more to cheer about. King and Charles to open the batting for the co-hosts. Boult with the new ball for the Kiwis - here we go! <strong>8:23pm</strong> The atmosphere at the venue is electric as both teams walk out for their respective national anthems. The New Zealand national anthem is up for, and will be followed by the West Indies' anthem. Neil: "NZ going in with 9 possible bowling options, 4 spinners in Santner, Phillips, Ravindra and Williamson, 5 seamers with Boult, Southee, Ferguson, Neesham and Mitchell" -- If NZ have to use that many, they'd likely be chasing a huge score... <b>Trent Boult:</b> (On the performance against Afghanistan) It was a long time ago. We had five or so days off, so plenty of time to review and understand where it went wrong. We were off the mark in all three facets and you cannot let that happen. (On the opposition) Needs no introduction tonight and we are looking forward to it. They are a dangerous side, they have eleven match-winners in their side. it is a great challenge and the boys cannot wait to get stuck in. This is a new venue for all of us really. Training has not been great. We were not able to train at the venue because the wickets were very, very friendly, as I would describe it. Trying to put on a better show than we did the other day. (On the lack of practice matches) The boys are coming off a winter. We could have played warm-up games. The draw has been unusual - we are into the second week, some teams have already qualified playing three (and we are playing just our second tonight). Not trying to make excuses but it has been pretty hard to get momentum from one game, but the boys are ready to get stuck in (tonight). <strong>8:15pm</strong> Plenty to dissect from the playing elevens. NZ have made three changes, which is slightly against what head coach Gary Stead hinted at prior to the game. There is an extra pace-bowling option in Neesham, although it will be interesting to see where and how NZ fit Rachin in, given their top three, on paper at least, looks stacked. Jimmy Neesham is back into the NZ team after missing their opener against Afghanistan. In the lead-up to the World Cup, <a href="https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1433664/jimmy-neesham----over-the-last-four-five-years--i-ve-embraced-walking-towards-pressure-in-big-moments">Neesham spoke</a> to ESPNcricinfo about dealing with pressure and his freelancing life <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> Quite pleasant, says Simon Doull about the weather. 10kph wind blowing through, perhaps to the slightly shorter side. 65m and 67m square boundaries, with a 74m hit straight down the ground. There was torrential rainfall yesterday but the ground staff have done very well to get the ground in pristine shape. The pitch has been re-laid so a bit of uncertainty. There could be some variable bounce and variable pace, and it could be a challenge for the batters, although Samuel Badree feels the West Indies could get up to the 180-run mark. <b>New Zealand XI:</b> Finn Allen, Devon Conway (wk), Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, James Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson, Trent Boult <b>West Indies XI:</b> Brandon King, Johnson Charles, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Roston Chase, Rovman Powell (c), Sherfane Rutherford, Andre Russell, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie <strong>8pm</strong> It's time for the toss. Powell and Williamson are out in the middle. Powell has the coin and he gives it a twirl. Tails is the call, and tails it is. <strong>New Zealand will bowl first.</strong> Says there are a few unknowns with regards to the surface and hence they want to bowl first. Adds that it was a tough match first up and that there were learnings from it. Tonight is about committing to who they are. <strong>Three changes for NZ - Southee in for Henry, Neesham in for Bracewell and Rachin in for Chapman.</strong> Powell says he would have bowled first too. Reckons a little bit of rest is also important because of how much cricket the players have played. There are still a few boxes they need to tick on the batting front that they would like to do tonight. Same team for the West Indies. <b>7:50pm</b> New Zealand have played just one game so far but that 84-run defeat has left them with barely any margin for error. This match has also morphed into a virtual knockout for them. Wondering how? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-scenarios-how-can-pakistan-england-sl-nz-still-qualify-1438051">This scenarios piece by S Rajesh should have you covered.</a> Ian: "Pretty easy tests for West Indies so far though, vs Uganda and PNG. Though NZ went straight into a final exam after neglecting to do any study. " -- For what it is worth, West Indies captain <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-rovman-powell-and-gary-stead-ahead-of-west-indies-vs-new-zealand-1438199">Rovman Powell does think that this is a good time to play New Zealand</a>, because of all that has happened. Here's a snippet from a little while ago from our man Matt Roller, who faced quite a trip to get to the stadium: Evening from Brian Lara Cricket Academy. 45 mins until the toss but there's already a decent crowd in with the grass banks filling up. Should be a lively atmosphere with a steel band playing out the back of the northern side of the ground. The teams have just arrived (and dodged the worst of the traffic thanks to a convoy) and are having a look at the pitch, which took a fair hit during the heavy showers yesterday <b>7:30pm</b> A studious student. Someone who is not always expected to be among the top four or five in a class, but somehow finds a way to be there, relying on a combination of preparation and knowing what his particular strengths are. This time, though, he did not come as prepared and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-new-zealand-14th-match-group-c-1415714/full-scorecard">flunked his first big test</a>, perhaps not even knowing what the questions were about, let alone answering them. Then there is another student, whose second name, for all we know, could be extravagance. There are no half-measures and often, it is boom or bust with him. He could top the class or he could fail miserably. He does not worry about the single-mark MCQs, rather focussing on gobbling up four and six-mark questions. Both of them now find themselves in direct competition with each other. A battle to get promoted to the next stage and to ensure their reputation is still intact. Both of them, because of what is at stake, will have their own plans, but only one will get what they are after. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of <b>Match 26</b> of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. <b>New Zealand</b>, often so prepared, looked woefully undone in their opener, and would want to show they are ready to revert to the mean. The <b>West Indies</b>, having passed their tests so far, will feel confident of becoming the first to ever top the T20 World Cup class on three different occasions. This is a proper high-stakes, high-jeopardy (especially for NZ), high-voltage clash. And whenever that is the case, it usually translates to plenty of entertainment and drama!

We had five or so days off, so plenty of time to review and understand where it went wrong. We were off the mark in all three facets and you cannot let that happen. (On the opposition) Needs no introduction tonight and we are looking forward to it. They are a dangerous side, they have eleven match-winners in their side. it is a great challenge and the boys cannot wait to get stuck in. This is a new venue for all of us really. Training has not been great. We were not able to train at the venue because the wickets were very, very friendly, as I would describe it. Trying to put on a better show than we did the other day. (On the lack of practice matches) The boys are coming off a winter. We could have played warm-up games. The draw has been unusual - we are into the second week, some teams have already qualified playing three (and we are playing just our second tonight). Not trying to make excuses but it has been pretty hard to get momentum from one game, but the boys are ready to get stuck in (tonight). <strong>8:15pm</strong> Plenty to dissect from the playing elevens. NZ have made three changes, which is slightly against what head coach Gary Stead hinted at prior to the game. There is an extra pace-bowling option in Neesham, although it will be interesting to see where and how NZ fit Rachin in, given their top three, on paper at least, looks stacked. Jimmy Neesham is back into the NZ team after missing their opener against Afghanistan. In the lead-up to the World Cup, <a href="https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1433664/jimmy-neesham----over-the-last-four-five-years--i-ve-embraced-walking-towards-pressure-in-big-moments">Neesham spoke</a> to ESPNcricinfo about dealing with pressure and his freelancing life <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> Quite pleasant, says Simon Doull about the weather. 10kph wind blowing through, perhaps to the slightly shorter side. 65m and 67m square boundaries, with a 74m hit straight down the ground. There was torrential rainfall yesterday but the ground staff have done very well to get the ground in pristine shape. The pitch has been re-laid so a bit of uncertainty. There could be some variable bounce and variable pace, and it could be a challenge for the batters, although Samuel Badree feels the West Indies could get up to the 180-run mark. <b>New Zealand XI:</b> Finn Allen, Devon Conway (wk), Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, James Neesham, Mitchell Santner, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson, Trent Boult <b>West Indies XI:</b> Brandon King, Johnson Charles, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Roston Chase, Rovman Powell (c), Sherfane Rutherford, Andre Russell, Romario Shepherd, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie <strong>8pm</strong> It's time for the toss. Powell and Williamson are out in the middle. Powell has the coin and he gives it a twirl. Tails is the call, and tails it is. <strong>New Zealand will bowl first.</strong> Says there are a few unknowns with regards to the surface and hence they want to bowl first. Adds that it was a tough match first up and that there were learnings from it. Tonight is about committing to who they are. <strong>Three changes for NZ - Southee in for Henry, Neesham in for Bracewell and Rachin in for Chapman.</strong> Powell says he would have bowled first too. Reckons a little bit of rest is also important because of how much cricket the players have played. There are still a few boxes they need to tick on the batting front that they would like to do tonight. Same team for the West Indies. <b>7:50pm</b> New Zealand have played just one game so far but that 84-run defeat has left them with barely any margin for error. This match has also morphed into a virtual knockout for them. Wondering how? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-scenarios-how-can-pakistan-england-sl-nz-still-qualify-1438051">This scenarios piece by S Rajesh should have you covered.</a> Ian: "Pretty easy tests for West Indies so far though, vs Uganda and PNG. Though NZ went straight into a final exam after neglecting to do any study. " -- For what it is worth, West Indies captain <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-rovman-powell-and-gary-stead-ahead-of-west-indies-vs-new-zealand-1438199">Rovman Powell does think that this is a good time to play New Zealand</a>, because of all that has happened. Here's a snippet from a little while ago from our man Matt Roller, who faced quite a trip to get to the stadium: Evening from Brian Lara Cricket Academy. 45 mins until the toss but there's already a decent crowd in with the grass banks filling up. Should be a lively atmosphere with a steel band playing out the back of the northern side of the ground. The teams have just arrived (and dodged the worst of the traffic thanks to a convoy) and are having a look at the pitch, which took a fair hit during the heavy showers yesterday <b>7:30pm</b> A studious student. Someone who is not always expected to be among the top four or five in a class, but somehow finds a way to be there, relying on a combination of preparation and knowing what his particular strengths are. This time, though, he did not come as prepared and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-new-zealand-14th-match-group-c-1415714/full-scorecard">flunked his first big test</a>, perhaps not even knowing what the questions were about, let alone answering them. Then there is another student, whose second name, for all we know, could be extravagance. There are no half-measures and often, it is boom or bust with him. He could top the class or he could fail miserably. He does not worry about the single-mark MCQs, rather focussing on gobbling up four and six-mark questions. Both of them now find themselves in direct competition with each other. A battle to get promoted to the next stage and to ensure their reputation is still intact. Both of them, because of what is at stake, will have their own plans, but only one will get what they are after. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of <b>Match 26</b> of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. <b>New Zealand</b>, often so prepared, looked woefully undone in their opener, and would want to show they are ready to revert to the mean. The <b>West Indies</b>, having passed their tests so far, will feel confident of becoming the first to ever top the T20 World Cup class on three different occasions. This is a proper high-stakes, high-jeopardy (especially for NZ), high-voltage clash. And whenever that is the case, it usually translates to plenty of entertainment and drama!
