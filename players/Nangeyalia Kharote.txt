<strong>ohh, bowled him!</strong> White is pumped up, and why not? Kharote falls first ball, and <strong>White is on a hat-trick</strong>. He tossed this ball up, and got it to dip just about expertly on a full length on middle and off. The ball seemed angled across, and turned away to hit off stump, as Kharote pushed at it away from his body
