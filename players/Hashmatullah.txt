But Afghanistan could have tried opening with him as his attacking style might work in Test Cricket too !!" Perhaps, although his aggressive approach does suit the middle order, which requires batting against a softer ball offering less movement. Thanks, Himanshu.

<strong>Edged, is that a drop at second slip by Balbirnie?</strong> He looks disappointed, McCarthy has hands on head. So, it looks like it. Was a very full ball around fifth, angling in from around the wicket, Shahidi went for the flowing drive through cover. He almost had to drill it out due to the fullness in length. The outside edge was found and it hovered low to the left of the fielder, was travelling quickly. The skipper got his left hand on it but couldn't hold on. Tough chance didn't stick.

Sits up and it's steered through backward point. On the shorter side, outside off too, Hashmat had ample time to rock back and open the face to pick four risk-free runs
McBrine has bowled a few great balls but has given the odd boundary ball. Afghanistan have been cashing in too

<strong>Is that strangled down leg? Umpire says yes, Hashmat reviews</strong>. Back-of-length ball down leg at 128ks. It was banged in and skiddy, didn't bounce much. Came up to just above the knee roll. Hashmat was inside the crease, opened the face fully and tried to help it leg side. There is a murmur with the ball next to the sticker of the bat as it passed. So, Hashmat has to go. McCarthy has some luck and his maiden Test wicket!

"Hi Ekanth, Is it true that all the 22 players are playing their first One Day International (ODI) match in today's match? Are both teams' XIs making their debuts? As CricInfo shows all the XI players in the "Player Debut" column." No, Laiq Khan Hamid, sadly it's a technical issue. It's being looked into. Two debutants in for Afghanistan though.

<strong>12.45pm</strong> The Sri Lanka team get in a final huddle before the second session. Rahmat and Shahidi stride out. Prabath Jayasuriya will continue <strong>12.37pm</strong> Hello folks. The action should get underway soon. Afghanistan have batted well so far, even as Sri Lanka have made two breakthroughs. Rahmat Shah is closing in on a half-century. Meanwhile, Prabath Jayasuriya is still hunting for his first wicket. His introduction did slow down the scoring rate. How will this second session go? Dulanjana: "Since Angelo Mathews is bowling in t20 side, I would like to see him bowling 2-3 overs here. Who knows maybe he can pickup some wickets as well." Hmm, I think Dhananjaya De Silva might be more threatening right now. With three seamers already bowling, it's the spin department that needs bolstering right now, for Sri Lanka.

but today Madushan does not take that kind of treatment! What a response. This is swinging in again, pitching on a length, and Hasmat is across already, expecting the angle to take the ball away from him. Madushan's wrists are working some magic though, because this comes back in at him, and it passes between bat and pad to hit the top of off. This is special from Madushan, who did this exact thing to a right-hander to get his first wicket.

Hashmatullah Shahidi b Pramod Madushan 7 (11b 1x4 0x6 10m) SR: 63.63
but today Madushan does not take that kind of treatment! What a response. This is swinging in again, pitching on a length, and Hasmat is across already, expecting the angle to take the ball away from him. Madushan's wrists are working some magic though, because this comes back in at him, and it passes between bat and pad to hit the top of off. This is special from Madushan, who did this exact thing to a right-hander to get his first wicket.

Yahampat: "Seems like a great opening partnership for Sri Lanka on both batting and bowling fronts! How fast are Madushanka and Madushan bowling?" MadushanKa has an extra K or two (see what I did there?) but his radar's been off.

length wide of off, first poor pall that Madushan has bowled. Hashmat gets forward and square drives this beautifully past point for four.

<strong>tosses up a delicious googly, and Shahidi has edge it to slip!</strong> Just suckered into playing the wrong line, as the ball loops up and dips. Not a lot of turn away from the left-hander, but enough to take the outside edge and that's a decent catch from Pathum Nissanka, who takes it low to the ground. Dananjaya's return is proving fruitful for Sri Lanka
