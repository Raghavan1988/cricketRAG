<b>11.33am:</b> Time for lunch. England could hardly have hoped for a better start after losing the toss and being asked to bowl, taking three early wickets through Wood (two) and Hartley. But Jadeja and Rohit - who was dropped by Root at slip and had an on-field lbw call overturned on review - have spent 16 overs together in the middle to steady the ship, and India will be pleased with their recovery. Ekanth will be here in half an hour to take you through the first half of the second session. John: "We'll likely never know for sure but that drop of Root's could be the difference between winning and losing. If India lost a fourth - their captain - at that stage then they might even be 5 or 6 down by now, given the lack of experience in that middle order. Instead, these two carry on serenely and put India close to parity at lunch." Ashish: "Sending Jadeja has been a masterstroke, with an experienced left-hander India team management has ensured things gets cooled down, after being 35 for 3." Scott: "First time I disagree with Shastri. Better to straighten the innings and then send in the newcomer than losing 4th wicket too quickly due to inexperience..."

Brain Scientist: "2 of the LBWs are umpires calls! Wonder if Stokesy is going to froth at the mouth tonight?! More like a cheshire cat that has sipped the milk tonight at the media meet!" That does seem more likely... bet he wishes the soft signal hadn't been binned off though...

<strong>an appeal for a stumping!</strong> Hung up on a length outside off. Jadeja moves across his stumps and then has a massive mow at it. In trying to put muscle behind the stroke, he over-balances and the back foot might just have snuck out of the crease. Litton was sharp in removing the bails and the back foot does seem to be on the line. The third umpire is having multiple looks at it, and this is indeed touch-and-go. <strong>This is taking an eternity. The third umpire is not quite sold on the idea of the back foot being on the line and he rules it not out!</strong>
