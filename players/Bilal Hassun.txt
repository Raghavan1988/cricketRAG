this is fuller, just outside off. Bilal fails to make contact with another wild slog. The ball clips the back leg and Afghanistan appeal. Impact again seemed an issue and the umpire was right to turn down the appeal

full just outside off. Bilal continues swinging like a rusty gate and gets pinned on the back leg again. Impact seemed to be outside the line but <strong>Afghanistan have reviewed it nevertheless. The initial assessment was indeed right. Impact just outside the line and Bilal survives!</strong>

off-pace on a back of a length on leg stump. Bilal walks down the track and whooshes across the line. Misses it by a mile and the ball somehow misses leg stump too!

<strong>that looks plumb!</strong> Googly on a length on off. Bilal, having not had enormous success with the conventional, now tries the reverse, rather ambitiously. Makes a complete hash of it and gets thumped on the front pad in front of off stump. Kumar Dharmasena gives it out but we go upstairs for a final ratification. <strong>No bat involved, and Ball Tracking has the ball smashing into middle stump, two-thirds of the way up!</strong>

<strong>big appeal, and given this time! Bilal has reviewed it immediately, though!</strong> Fizzed through on a length on middle and off. This is the leg-spinner and it turns away just enough to beat the bat and smack Bilal on the back leg. The swiftness of the review, however, suggests there might have been bat involved. <strong>That is indeed the case. A big outside edge, and Bilal stays!</strong>
