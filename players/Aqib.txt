<strong>Starc strikes again!</strong> But is that going down leg? Ilyas reviews. It's that full inswinger to the right-hander again. But there is a question of whether it pitched in line and whether it was swinging down leg. Ilyas missed his attempted flick. But that's pitching outside leg. Ilyas survives

Oman skipper Aqib Ilyas is the new batter. He got a first-baller from Ruben Trumpelmann in the last game.

Almost a first-baller this time as well, but it just beats the cover fielder! It's a low full toss fired across Ilyas, who opens the face and drives it aerially in front of point. The cover fielder hurled himself to his left, but in the end the ball was well wide of him

Huge mix-up and Oman could have lost one to a run-out here! Oh no, the batter may have just survived here. Australia miss a big opportunity! This was flicked to Head's right at midwicket and the batter took off. Prajapati at the non-striker's wasn't sure and he sent Ilyas back and when Head's throw came in at the striker's end, Ilyas was nowhere in sight. But the throw missed the keeper and the stumps and by the time the stumps were thrown down, he made his ground
