Trumpelmann to finish. The loss of Wiese for that over was potentially significant. England, incidentally, need eight to prove that 109 from ten overs against Scotland might have been attainable... A bit of sawdust for the bowler's front foot. This will eat into the window before the next rain is incoming...

over the wicket, slower ball, in the arc, <B>Moeen latches on with alacrity!</B> He held his stroke wonderfully, waiting that split-second for the ball to arrive and mashed over long-on
