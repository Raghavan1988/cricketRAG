[{"type": "HTML", "html": "<b>8.45pm</b> An innings that swung both ways, ends with Sri Lanka probably short of what they would have wanted on the scoreboard. Dhananjaya de Silva was Sri Lanka's aggressor in the first powerplay, but he found little support as Sri Lanka were suddenly in trouble at 55 for four. But then Wanindu Hasaranga, promoting himself up to No. 6, came in and counterattacked. His 32-ball 67 saw Sri Lanka back on track for a good finish, but a late collapse saw them go from 146 for 5 to 160 all out. Afghanistan's pacers used the slower to great effect. Will Sri Lanka take some tips from that? And can Hasaranga and Theekshana fare better than Noor and Qais? We'll find out soon enough. Join me back in around 15 minutes for the chase."}]<b>8.45pm</b> An innings that swung both ways, ends with Sri Lanka probably short of what they would have wanted on the scoreboard.
