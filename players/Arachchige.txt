Arachchige is OUT! lbw

Sahan Arachchige lbw b Sikandar Raza 21 (39b 2x4 0x6 40m) SR: 53.84
this is given lbw after a loud, confident appeal, but <B>Arachchige reviews</B> rather immediately. It seemed like this was too high, but we'll see. That was bowled on a length, while being angled into the left-hander. Replays show there is no inside edge, as he looked to nudge from middle and off. The ball pitched just outside off, and turned in. Ball tracking show it would have turned in to hit the top of middle stump. Zimbabwe land another blow, as the spinners get into the action
