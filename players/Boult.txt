Trent Boult c Smith b Zampa 16 (11b 1x4 1x6 15m) SR: 145.45
<b>outside edge</b> and he's gone. Slows it right down. Keeps it tossed up. Boult's eyes light up, seeing he has more opportunities for big hits. The other trick Zampa does here is angle the ball into the right-hander, making him hit against the turn. From there, a little dip, a little grip and money for Smith at backward point
