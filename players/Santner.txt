<b>There it is! A Trinidadian tale of triumph to tell for Rovman Powell and his team!</b> Dug in short outside off. Santner has another mow at it and heaves it towards deep mid wicket. Does not matter, though because it is the West Indies that march on to the Super Eight, and they are smiles in the dugout, even as the Kiwis wonder what next is in store for them!
<strong>12:35am</strong> That will be all from us for this game. They will be dancing their hearts out in Trinidad and why not. The West Indies are through to the Super Eight, and they will have a proper crack at becoming the first team to lift the T20 World Cup thrice. Not as much joy for NZ, and they know the enormity of the task that awaits them now. It was a pleasure bringing this contest to you, especially with all the twists and turns that took place. Hope you enjoyed our coverage, and until next time, this is goodbye from me (Shashwat), Ranjith, Vairavan and everyone at ESPNcricinfo. Take care, folks! <b>Rovman Powell, West Indies captain:</b> Very happy (with the performance). From the outside, we told our guys someone will have to play a blinder (because of how the pitch could be due to inclement weather) We always believe individual brilliance is needed. That (Rutherford) innings gave us confidence and belief. We watched what they did well and tried to replicate it. Hard length was difficult (to get away). We sat down as a bowling length and decided to hit a hard length, with the spinners trying to spin the ball. (On bowling the spinners early) You have to use what you have. We don't have as many fast bowlers as NZ. We have three spinners, so have to push them as much as I can. (On the crowd support) It was fantastic. I was sitting there with Nicholas and it was such a beautiful night for someone to stand up and be counted. Unfortunate some of our batters could not but glad to get the win. <b>Kane Williamson, New Zealand captain:</b> (On their powerplay bowling) It was good. We had an inkling that it was going to be tricky if you hit an area, and that proved to be the case. On these surfaces, you have to find a way and an over or two can be the difference. The quality of Sherfane's innings was high. The batting depth in their side was beneficial for sure. We knew there were going to be some tough overs there. We tried to take the aggressive option to take wickets. (On Santner's ability to bowl to left-handers) We know that and we have full trust in that. We saw how tricky it was when you hit the wicket and we were certainly trying to execute as well as we could. The margins are small, 2-3 balls here and there, and the score can get up high. (On their lack of preparation) You get the prep that you get and you do as well as you can. You have to get your head around the conditions. We cannot make excuses and have to find ways. We need to bounce back quickly. We are back on in a couple of days and we want to see better and smarter performances. The effort was there, and important that we pick ourselves up and go again. <b>Sherfane Rutherford, Player of the Match:</b> I want to thank God for the opportunity. (On scoring 68 and his jersey number also being 68) I am going to keep 68 close to my heart. (On his preparation for the tournament) I was in the IPL for two months, so I was preparing, even though I was not playing. I did a lot of work and did my planning. Keeping it simple and backing my skill - I think that was the key. (On his thought process tonight) I was just telling myself to take it deep. Me and Sammy had a talk and I knew if we got momentum, I could make it up in the end. Looking at their bowling line-up, I knew they were short of two overs. I knew they had to make up those overs and I wanted to maximise it. (On making the Super Eight) It is one tick in the box, but it is only the start of something big to come. Hopefully we can continue the momentum. <strong>12:11am</strong> It is a little past midnight in Trinidad, but no one at the ground is leaving early. They came to party tonight, and their team has delivered a performance fitting of the occasion. It was not always that way, mind you, and the crowd only began finding its voice towards the end of the first innings. Once that happened, the West Indies grew in stature, almost like they felt they just could not lose in front of this crowd. Rutherford's inspirational knock was followed up by an equally impressive bowling display. Motie was the star of the show in the middle overs, backing up Hosein's tidy powerplay bowling. Joseph then returned later in the innings, truly killing off the Kiwis' run-chase and ensuring that they lost for the second game running. Speaking of New Zealand, it was another shoddy day at work with the bat. 149 was not an easy target to chase, but their lack of intent was surprising. That meant they fell behind the rate early and when the wickets fell, that only spiralled. There were cameos by Allen, Phillips and Santner but none of them were able to grab the game by the scruff of its neck like Rutherford did earlier in the evening. They now have a mountain to climb in the games that remain, and will need an extraordinary turn of events to make it to the next stage.
