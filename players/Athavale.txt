Pratik Athavale lbw b Starc 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 3m) SR: 0
Starc goes up in appeal as a low inswinging full toss hits Athavale on the pads. But did he get an inside edge first? <strong>Australia review</strong>. Athavale was looking to flick. But this looks to have hit pad first before deflecting onto the bat and back onto his feet. And ball tracking on DRS shows that to be smashing the base of middle stump. Golden duck for Athavale. Starc strikes in the first over
