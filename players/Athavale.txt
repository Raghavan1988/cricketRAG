Richie Berrington isn't too unhappy with being put into the field. "First game here, short boundary. We will have to assess the wicket and see what works."

Might need a sub-100 bowling performance to really pay off." And with that, let's get on with the show <b>2.53pm:</b> Johnny E: "Dare I ask, what are the chances of rain?" Think it's OK. It's hot and humid, but who knows what this breeze brings in. Think we'll be fine, but don't hold me to that <b>2.45pm:</b> Vicky: "In contrast to many folks commenting here on England's decision to bowl, I am with Buttler here. If England can restrict Oman to a paltry total, they can try and chase it ASAP and thus, give further boost to their NRR." John : "People do realise that chasing a total really quickly also boosts NRR don't they?" Yeah, think this is the thing, really. Whatever Oman set - and they're not the most ambitious batting side - England just need to blitz. With the cross-breeze here, Reece Topley is going to be a big threat. And if the Namibia game is anything to go by, Oman's top order aren't all that keen on left-arm seam - Ruben Trumpelmann had them <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/namibia-vs-oman-3rd-match-group-b-1415703/full-scorecard">10 for 3 in the third over</a>... <b>2:42pm:</b> A selection of your reactions to the toss... Neil: "Why, ENG, WHY?? You keep choosing to chase and it goes pear-shaped. Why not get a score - not least in view of NRR!" Areeb: "Why does Buttler like to keep on electing to bowl. Has he got some kind of allergy to setting a target. He did the same thing in the 2023 world cup and continues to do the same regardless of conditions. When will he learn" Eye Gee : "Aah...another dumb decision by England. If it really is a good wicket then bat 1st on it and pile up a huge score! That would actually help you get a good margin in there with NRR." <b>2.31pm:</b> News from the middle of the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium is <b>England have won the toss and elected to bowl first!</b> "It looks a really good wicket and we'd like to know what total we're chasing," says Jos Buttler. Breezy conditions and blue skies in Antigua. "We've got to earn the right to win before looking at what we need to do." One change for England, with Reece Topley replacing Chris Jordan. Oman skipper Aqib Ilyas: "We wanted to bowl first but you can't depend on the toss. It's a very good wicket, a very good flat track to bat on." <strong>England XI:</strong> 1 Phil Salt, 2 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 3 Will Jacks, 4 Jonny Bairstow, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Liam Livingstone, 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Jofra Archer 9. Mark Wood, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Reece Topley <strong>Oman XI: </strong>1 Pratik Athavale (wk), 2 Kashyap Prajapati, 3 Aqib Ilyas (capt), 4 Zeeshan Maqsood, 5 Khalid Kail, 6 Ayaan Khan, 7 Shoaib Khan, 8 Mehran Khan, 9 Fayyaz Butt, 10 Kaleemulah, 11 Bilal Khan <b>2.23pm:</b> Vinod: "Eng have to beat Oman and Namibia with the combined margin of 115 runs to qualify even if Aus beats Scotland in super over. I believe it is practically possible to win by 60 odd runs against both the teams." So many strands, but did enjoy Scotland opener Michael Jones positing the idea of <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-michael-jones-on-run-rate-furore-if-david-warner-opens-the-bowling-it-d-be-pretty-funny-1438527">David Warner opening the bowling</a> <b>2.20pm:</b> Odinlass: "I think England are in for a revamp regardless of their Super Eight qualification. Time for some players to say goodbye if the team wants to actually compete." Well part of that is based on the age profile of some of the squad. Pretty sure they all want to compete <b>2.11pm:</b> Shaun: "England have two games to determine the T20 World Cup future. If they miss out on super 8 qualification then  coach and captain will be replaced." And a few of the players, you'd think... huge four days ahead <B>2:00pm:</b> Hello and welcome to the latest episode of The Net Run Rate Diaries! After all the talk of the last week about margins and contorted run chases, we finally have some actual cricket. I know, I can't believe it either. Our resident stats warlock, S Rajesh, has <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-scenarios-how-can-pakistan-england-sl-nz-still-qualify-1438051">outlined the permutations</a> that England and the other slim hopefuls throughout this World Cup require to make it to the Super Eights. For Jos Buttler's charges, tonight against Oman is the first step towards obtaining the 94-run swing they require in their next two matches (they face Namibia on Saturday) before their hate-watch of Group B's last fixture between Australia and Scotland. Toss and team news on the way soon. For now, here's our <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/england-vs-oman-28th-match-group-b-1415728/match-preview">match preview</a>.
