Simon Dedman : "I'd like to pre register "it's the hope that kills you" if Shai does indeed drag the the Windies over the line "

<B>full and wide, blatted over deep point!</B> It is indeed the Hope that kills England! In the slot for an open-faced carve, clears the rope by a distance. And West Indies claim the series 3-2 and a white-ball clean-sweep!
<B>7.35pm</B> And for the third time this year, West Indies clinch a T20I series on home soil. It's been a fantastic campaign, and a wonderful marker ahead of the World Cup next year. For England, much to ponder. They had high hopes after their fightback in mid-series, but they came a cropper today. Clearly there's plenty to work with in this squad, but the defending champions will need to find some consistency before June. And with that, it's a wrap from England in 2023. It's been a remarkable year, with Bazball highs and World Cup lows, and strange T20 fluctuations in between. Make of it what you will. From Miller, Alan, Matt, Valkerie, Vish, Paul and the UK team, plus Binoy and the scorers, thanks and goodnight, and Merry Christmas one and all! <B>7.26pm</B> Here's the presentations. The Player of the Match is <B>Gudakesh Motie</B>... 3 for 24 in England's innings: "I know my ability, the pitch was assisting, put the ball in the right area. It was important to hit my length. I've been working on it over the years and I see it as my strength. It's my second series, means a lot to me, total team effort." The Player of the Series is <B>Phil Salt</B>, after 331 runs at 185 strike-rate. "Disappointing to come out on the wrong side, but we'll be better for the coming months. I feel good at the minute, learning off Jos, keep trying to take in as much as I can. It's been a challenge, a lot more on the toss in this part of the world. A big part of the game. You've always got more time than you think." <B>Jos Buttler</B>: "Conditions were different, didn't adapt quickly enough. 160 would have been good. A really good effort with the ball. Salt's had a fantastic series, back to back hundreds, found out lots about ourselves, take the learnings and try to improve. The breeze plays a big part here, big premium on six-hitting, had a great time coming here to the Caribbean." <B>Rovman Powell</B>: "Special thanks to the people of Trinidad and Tobago. Spent some time yesterday having meetings, still a good bowling team. Losing wickets at a key time  but Shai Hope was the key man, grafting in the middle order. Served our batting group well. Credit to the groundsmen across the Caribbean. Credit to them, hats off, they did fantastic. We found players standing up and in good teams that happens. I have a good bunch of guys around me, they respect me and trust my judgment. I try to lead and the guys follow." <B>7.15pm</B> Well, what a series that was! England's 132 was significantly below par, but they fought and fought and took it as deep as they could. Adil Rashid was magnificent, as was Reece Topley, while Sam Curran's final over was superb. But Shai Hope's run-a-ball 43 did the needful, with Sherfane Rutherford and Johnson Charles chipping in with useful hands. It's a marker laid down by the hosts for the 2024 World Cup, that's for sure! Rahul: "Well, if you put this in VERY simple words - England didn't bat out 4 deliveries - about the SAME as what WI have left. Sums up?" Very fitting that the series was sealed with a six too... it's been the theme of these five games... <a href=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=3;filter=advanced;groupby=series;orderby=sixes;template=results;tournament_type=2;type=batting>120 in five matches! Gosh</A> JaySav: "Wow, clutch 19th over Curran (1 for 2) comes to naught. Looked like he almost dragged England back into it, but they were always behind." Drew: "@Rahul the reason England didn't face those 4 deliveries is because they were all out. WI finished 6 down. Hence the 4 wicket win. It is the 4 wickets that made the difference."

Shai Hope c Short b Bartlett 12 (17b 1x4 0x6 23m) SR: 70.58
<strong>Flashes, edges to slip</strong>. Bartlett has three in the powerplay. Wide on a fullish length, 129ks, huge away swing. Hope threw his hands at it, tried flaying over cover, the back foot went across upon impact. But the movement had the ball hit bat on the toe rather than in the middle. Catch to Short at first slip came around shoulder-height.

Sun is setting. Lights have taken full effect. Zampa continues. Thanks Ekanth. Sean Abbott on the Fox mic: "We're thought anything over 220 would be quite competitive. It's a very slow wicket. We've got some work to do. This is a key partnership."

Nabi comes around the wicket, it does not matter for Hope. Angled across him, it was the length ball. Hope clears his front leg and slogs it over deep midwicket again. The longer side, with the wind and it sails over

MB IBRAHIMI : "Gulbadin Nain will be very handy in such situations, his slow leg and off cutter will stop batters from such big hitting. Nabi is purposely not coming to bowling, I guess!" Wouldn't be a bad idea to try Nabi on against Hope and Pooran. <b>Here's Rashid though</b>

<b>Najibullah takes a screamer</b> and Naib strikes with his first ball. Najib made good ground to his right from deep midwicket while running in a bit, dives full length then to grab this slog sweep to end Hope's stay. Naib begins with a legcutter outside off at 100.9kph, which Hope looks to hit with the wind. But it was the longer side and he pays the price. The signature biceps pose from Naib
