Here's Shaik: "Would have loved to see Shami bowl in the first hour today. Don't know if luck would have favoured him or not is an other issue. But the Straight Seam coming out of his hand, on this pitch will be Pure Magical Test Stuff for Test lovers." And who doesn't like Pure Magical Test Stuff?

"Has England finally decided not to approach Bazball style with India in India??" Well, it was a circumspect start in testing conditions, Kunal Kushwaha. But the run rate is now just shy of 4 RPO

Pope is OUT! stumped
st †Jurel b Kuldeep Yadav
Ollie Pope st †Jurel b Kuldeep Yadav 11 (24b 0x4 0x6 29m) SR: 45.83
<b>comes down and strung up, Jurel completes the stumping!</b> Kuldeep foxes Pope with the googly and plucks out a second wicket on the stroke of lunch! India can walk off feeling a tad bit more satisfied with their work this morning. Pope was nowhere near the ball as it skidded on with the angle from over the wicket. He threw his head back in frustration, another low score to add to his collection in India
<B>11.33am:</b> Lots to take in there - even before you factor in the view of the Himalayas. England's openers rode their luck during another half-century stand, and Zak Crawley has looked increasingly assured to be 61 not out from 71 at lunch. India's seamers were luckless despite drawing 25 false responses in the first hour but Kuldeep Yadav ensured that the hosts would get something from the session by removing Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope in his first five overs. There's been seam movement, bounce and some spin, but you'd expect conditions to be good for batting as the day wears on. Join Sid Monga again in half an hour Indian footballer Chinglensana Singh was playing a match in Kerala when he first heard about the violence in Manipur. His family home was burnt down and the football turf he had built was destroyed. Ten months on, he talks about the <a href="https://www.espn.in/football/story/_/id/39644389/chinglensana-singh-manipur-10-months-violence-haunts-us-family-moving-on " target="_blank"> kind of trauma he and his family underwent </a> and the struggle to set things back to normal
