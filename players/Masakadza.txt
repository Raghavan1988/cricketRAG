Short and going across him, Masakadza pulls it out to cow corner and they go for two. <strong>And Gumbie is in trouble!</strong>  The throw was a good one and Young did well to collect it high and then take the bails off at the non-striker's end. Gumbie put in a dive at full stretch, but he was still caught short and the run-out ends a dogged effort that sees him fall six short of his highest ODI score. That was good fielding by McBrine in the deep, sweeping in from wide long-on and getting a good throw in

Do join us for the run chase after a short break This has been a really contrasted innings. With the bat, Zimbabwe got off to a strong start, scoring 36 in the opening five overs. However, they have been losing wickets ever then, conceding five wickets in the span of five runs. Then, Madande and Masakadza attempted to salvage the innings with a 75 runs partnership. Masakdza hit few huge shots after Madande departed, pushing Zimbabwe past the 120-runs mark. The bowlers from Bangladesh, particularly Mahedi, Saifuddin, and Taskin, bowled incredibly well. Whenever they bowled, they were incredibly precise and accurate with the line and length. <strong>Bangladesh requires 125 runs to win the match</strong>
