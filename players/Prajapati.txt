<strong>10.20pm</strong> So, two fifties of differing natures have powered Australia to 164. Can Oman chase this down? The openers - Kashyap Prajapati and Pratik Athavale -  step out. Mitchell Starc - but of course - has the new ball in hand. Ashton Agar, meanwhile, is on as a substitute fielder for Australia.

<b>Gorgeous square drive to begin with!</b> It's full outside off, swinging back in. Prajapati leans into the drive and caresses it through point

<strong>That looks plumb! And given immediately.</strong> But Oman review. This is on full around middle. Was there an inside edge as Prajapati looked to flick?
