How is the weather " --- The umbrellas are out because it's quite sunny out there. <b>9am</b> Hello and welcome to the second Test between South Africa and India in Cape Town. South Africa has been India's final frontier - they have never won a Test series here - and it remains so, after they were trounced in Centurion. Their are questions aplenty for India as they look to draw the series. South Africa will be looking to make it 2-0 and give Dean Elgar a fitting farewell. Elgar will also be leading the side as Temba Bavuma got injured on the opening day of the first Test. I am Hemant Brar and will soon be joined by Shashank Kishore as we bring you all the action.

Mitan: "Lots of spin !!! Did SA made a mistake by not picking Maharaj?" --- If dew comes into play could end up being the right call. Bimal: "Excellent Captaincy so far. Back to our main strength. Spin bowling. A wicket is near it feels." Aquib Mohammed : "Is Nepal bowling well or SA batting cautiously or the pitch is slow and difficult?  And if it is not easy to score then why the live forecast is 182?" --- Combination of factors I think. The PTSD from the earlier games is probably adding to South Africa's cautious approach, but at the same time Nepal haven't really offered up any loose deliveries. Also, there is definitely turn on offer in this pitch and Nepal have spinners for days! <B>Drinks</b>
