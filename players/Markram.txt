<B> excellent ball and India strike early. </B> Siraj goes full on fourth stump, gets the ball to shape away late. Markram is drawn forward and instinctively into a drive, ends up going with hard hands and the edge is pouched superbly by Yashasvi Jaiswal diving to his left in front of second slip. He tumbled over but had full control of the ball.

this one comes in with the angle, and maybe jags a bit off the seam as well and hits Markram in the box! Mathews isn't bowling very fast (decidedly in the 120kph range), but he's getting some movement and making Markram uncomfortable. He needs some medical attention after that.
