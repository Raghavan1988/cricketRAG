another excellent yorker to end things...Stoinis throws down the stumps, Australia appeal this time, and the ball ends up at the boundary. Holder safely in his ground. So that will be four runs! What a silly finish that was
<b>Australia win by 34 runs</b> in a match that will be remember for Glenn Maxwell's stunning century. West Indies needed everything to go their way in the chase - they gave it a good crack, but lost too many early wickets. The closing stages were, frankly, bizarre with the non-appeal run out. Didn't impact the result, but made for a very odd finish. Max: "The replays don't convince me that an appeal was made… the bowler's turned to go back to the top of his mark and the captain's standing with his hands on his head. Good call I reckon! Cricket 101: umpire can't give it out unless there's an appeal." <b>Glenn Maxwell</b> is player of the match: "Probably just didn't hit the gaps straightaway...probably expecting too much of myself early on. We knew we were going to cash in at the back 10. I made a good decision against Akeal and slog-swept that one, felt I was really clear. Showed I was watching the ball. Was proud of that. Went through the waves, mistimed a couple, but stayed pretty clear. I feel really comfortable in this format, over the last 18 months have felt really clear. While I'm going well just trying to ride that." <b>Rovman Powell</b> "The boys showed courage, but we kept losing wickets at key interval and failed to get big partnerships. But credit to Australia, they bowled well. We knew if we were going to get close we had to have wickets. Those things do happen when chasing 240. It's very difficult, [against Maxwell] he tend to have a shot for it but he strayed from our plans a little. A 2-1 series better than 3-0. The guys are still confident." <b>Mitchell Marsh</b> "Thought it was a great game. Thought 220 was par, so needed every bit of that 240. [Maxwell's] always done it...it's always unbelievable. We are incredibly lucky to have. him. Think we've played some really good T20 cricket over the last six months. Thought there were key moments in the innings we won, but they bat down to ten. They are a formidable team." I'll wrap things up there for tonight. Another high-scoring contest between these two teams. We'll be back for the final match on Tuesday but until then, from Gnasher and Alex, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.

another excellent yorker to end things...Stoinis throws down the stumps, Australia appeal this time, and the ball ends up at the boundary. Holder safely in his ground. So that will be four runs! What a silly finish that was
<b>Australia win by 34 runs</b> in a match that will be remember for Glenn Maxwell's stunning century. West Indies needed everything to go their way in the chase - they gave it a good crack, but lost too many early wickets. The closing stages were, frankly, bizarre with the non-appeal run out. Didn't impact the result, but made for a very odd finish. Max: "The replays don't convince me that an appeal was made… the bowler's turned to go back to the top of his mark and the captain's standing with his hands on his head. Good call I reckon! Cricket 101: umpire can't give it out unless there's an appeal." <b>Glenn Maxwell</b> is player of the match: "Probably just didn't hit the gaps straightaway...probably expecting too much of myself early on. We knew we were going to cash in at the back 10. I made a good decision against Akeal and slog-swept that one, felt I was really clear. Showed I was watching the ball. Was proud of that. Went through the waves, mistimed a couple, but stayed pretty clear. I feel really comfortable in this format, over the last 18 months have felt really clear. While I'm going well just trying to ride that." <b>Rovman Powell</b> "The boys showed courage, but we kept losing wickets at key interval and failed to get big partnerships. But credit to Australia, they bowled well. We knew if we were going to get close we had to have wickets. Those things do happen when chasing 240. It's very difficult, [against Maxwell] he tend to have a shot for it but he strayed from our plans a little. A 2-1 series better than 3-0. The guys are still confident." <b>Mitchell Marsh</b> "Thought it was a great game. Thought 220 was par, so needed every bit of that 240. [Maxwell's] always done it...it's always unbelievable. We are incredibly lucky to have. him. Think we've played some really good T20 cricket over the last six months. Thought there were key moments in the innings we won, but they bat down to ten. They are a formidable team." I'll wrap things up there for tonight. Another high-scoring contest between these two teams. We'll be back for the final match on Tuesday but until then, from Gnasher and Alex, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.

<B>width on a full length, a futile boundary to finish!</B> Flashed away through deep third, but it's immaterial. Australia have turned up, England have not!
<B>4.52pm</B> So, that's a wrap. It was a thrilling spectacle for roughly three-quarters of the match, and then it was an Australian cakewalk. Real trouble again for England in a global tournament. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-england-17th-match-group-b-1415717/points-table-standings>Here's the state of the Group B table. </A> They will need big victories against Oman and Namibia, and hope the other results go their way... we've heard that one before. Australia, meanwhile, march on with formidable poise. Are we looking at the triple world champions-elect? We can only keep watching and find out. From Miller, Alan and Thilak, good night! <B>Jos Buttler:</B> "They came out with a lot of intent, under a lot of pressure straightaway, we fought well,  but they took wickets at crucial times and played really well. Hindsight gives lots of decisions you could have changed, extreme conditions with the short side and the wind. Jofra bowled really well but looked like he hasn't been away at all, such variety and skill. Great to have him back. Outside the powerplay was going to be the challenge, credit to Australia, their seamers were very consistent, making us hit to the long side. We came second today, but it's all laid out for us, what we need to do." <B>Mitch Marsh:</B> "Very pleased, allround game was outstanding, great game. The powerplay was the difference in the game, we learnt lessons from the first game, to trust our games. The bowlers did their thing, we have an experienced group. Patty was outstanding, tough end to bowl with the wind going across. Needed hard overs from the big guns. We'll keep learning in these conditions, keep improving and keep progressing through the tournament." <B>Adam Zampa is player of the match</B>: "We play England a lot, we know their players. We've trained here and know the dimensions. A massive breeze, getting England hitting to the long boundary, difficult to hit sixes and fours. Hard to play cross-bat shots against me.

<B>width on a full length, a futile boundary to finish!</B> Flashed away through deep third, but it's immaterial. Australia have turned up, England have not!
<B>4.52pm</B> So, that's a wrap. It was a thrilling spectacle for roughly three-quarters of the match, and then it was an Australian cakewalk. Real trouble again for England in a global tournament. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-england-17th-match-group-b-1415717/points-table-standings>Here's the state of the Group B table. </A> They will need big victories against Oman and Namibia, and hope the other results go their way... we've heard that one before. Australia, meanwhile, march on with formidable poise. Are we looking at the triple world champions-elect? We can only keep watching and find out. From Miller, Alan and Thilak, good night! <B>Jos Buttler:</B> "They came out with a lot of intent, under a lot of pressure straightaway, we fought well,  but they took wickets at crucial times and played really well. Hindsight gives lots of decisions you could have changed, extreme conditions with the short side and the wind. Jofra bowled really well but looked like he hasn't been away at all, such variety and skill. Great to have him back. Outside the powerplay was going to be the challenge, credit to Australia, their seamers were very consistent, making us hit to the long side. We came second today, but it's all laid out for us, what we need to do." <B>Mitch Marsh:</B> "Very pleased, allround game was outstanding, great game. The powerplay was the difference in the game, we learnt lessons from the first game, to trust our games. The bowlers did their thing, we have an experienced group. Patty was outstanding, tough end to bowl with the wind going across. Needed hard overs from the big guns. We'll keep learning in these conditions, keep improving and keep progressing through the tournament." <B>Adam Zampa is player of the match</B>: "We play England a lot, we know their players. We've trained here and know the dimensions. A massive breeze, getting England hitting to the long boundary, difficult to hit sixes and fours. Hard to play cross-bat shots against me. Some of the wickets in the Windies you need to sum up on the spot, looking at how Rash bowled as well helped. We have great depth with our bowling attack, playing all different roles."

Ben Shikongo c David b Stoinis 0 (4b 0x4 0x6 3m) SR: 0
<strong>a superb catch to end the Namibian innings! Australia have rolled them over for 72!</strong> Zipped in full on middle and leg. Seems to hold in the surface and Shikongo, trying to work to leg, gets a tame leading edge. David calls for it early, sprints to his left and takes the catch with a slide across the surface. A professional end to a professional bowling display!
<strong>10pm</strong> Not the batting outing Namibia would have been hoping for. Put into bat, they found themselves in all sorts of trouble in the powerplay, losing three. Erasmus then scratched around, taking an especially long time to get off the mark. The others around him did not do him any favours and in the end, it was Erasmus' 36 that took Namibia past 50 and helped them get up to 72. As abject as Namibia's batting was, Australia were sensational. Hazlewood set the tone early, with Cummins also getting into the wicket-taking act during the field restrictions. Thereafter, it was the Zampa show. He picked up four, bamboozled the Namibian batters and barely offered them any respite. He also got to 100 T20I wickets in a process, capping off an excellent evening in Antigua. This score does not feel nearly enough at this stage, and Australia might want to wrap up this chase soon. But if Namibia are to make a fist of this, we will have seen something extraordinarily special. Join us in a bit! <b>Josh Hazlewood:</b> (On his performance) I think the wicket was pretty good. When Zampa came on, it started to spin quite a bit. Good all-round effort from our boys. (On squad rotation) We have 15 players to pick from. Few of the games are back-to-back. When you get to the Super Eight, the matches come quick. Adapting to conditions is key. It is different everywhere.
