He also got to 100 T20I wickets in a process, capping off an excellent evening in Antigua. This score does not feel nearly enough at this stage, and Australia might want to wrap up this chase soon. But if Namibia are to make a fist of this, we will have seen something extraordinarily special. Join us in a bit! <b>Josh Hazlewood:</b> (On his performance) I think the wicket was pretty good. When Zampa came on, it started to spin quite a bit. Good all-round effort from our boys. (On squad rotation) We have 15 players to pick from. Few of the games are back-to-back. When you get to the Super Eight, the matches come quick. Adapting to conditions is key. It is different everywhere.
