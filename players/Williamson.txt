Here's <b>Tshepo Moreki</b>: Just tried to breathe, you are always going to be nervous, it's your first Test and all that, just tried to control it best as you can and hope for the best. [Signing autographs] Kids have been asking, it will be rude to say no. They have been quite nice out there, been supportive, has been great to far. [On the session so far] We are in a  pretty good position, we would have taken this. Just keep applying the pressure and the rewards will come. Jason: "South Africa's session, but disappointing over rate." <b>1.03pm</b> Good first session for South Africa, who won the toss and prised out two New Zealand wickets and just conceded 65 runs in 25 overs. The visitors would have dearly wanted a third, but made sure they did not let New Zealand get away at any stage. Tshepo Moreki, one of six South Africa debutants today picked up Devon Conway off his first ball lbw. Kane Williamson and Tom Latham steadied the ship for a bit before Dane Paterson sent Latham packing with an outswinger. Rachin Ravindra had his moments but has hung around with Williamson who looks solid yet again. Can South Africa make inroads after the break? Join Vishal in a bit to find out.

<strong>inswinging yorker</strong>, a slightly belated appeal for lbw, it's yorked Williamson and then gone over the keeper and slips for four! Bizarre play here, but more importantly no review and it's given as runs off the bat. That ball dipped in, took the toe end of the bat as it jammed into the ground and bounced off the ground to go over the slips

<strong>that looks very adjacent, but it is not given!</strong> Full and zipped into middle and off. Williamson, having walked across his stumps, misses his flick. Gets pinned right in front but Kumar Dharmasena is unmoved. Afghanistan, unsurprisingly, go upstairs and if Williamson has not hit this, he could be on his way. <strong>Clear gap between bat and ball. Ball Tracking up now, and it shows the ball would have clipped leg stump. Umpire's Call, and Williamson survives. Wow, that jagged back considerably. Afghanistan cannot believe it!</strong>
