<b>6.30pm</b> New Zealand dominate the day again and it all started with an epic double-century from Rachin Ravindra who scored 240 the first time he crossed the 100-mark. New Zealand racked up 511 and will be quite happy with the four wickets they took out of the seven that fell in the last session. The South Africa openers started quite well, survived nicely for more than half hour before Jamieson struck twice in an over with the new ball and Henry bounced out a well-set and impressive Edward Moore. It looked like Bedingham and Hamza were going to take them through, the way they were middling those boundaries, but Hamza was bowled in strange fashion and South Africa finish 431 runs behind with only six wickets in hand. They will hope conditions get even better for batting tomorrow, whereas the hosts will hunt for more wickets because they've done half the job of batting big. Ashish Pant and I, Vishal Dikshit, will be back in time again tomorrow while rubbing our eyes so do join us again. And if you've missed today's action, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/south-africa-in-new-zealand-2023-24-1388186/new-zealand-vs-south-africa-1st-test-1388221/match-report">Ashish's day report</a> will be up here soon enough.
