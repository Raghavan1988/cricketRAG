Can they do it on a <strong>fresh pitch with the last international game happening nearly a decade ago</strong>?"}]<strong>10.46am</strong> Thanks, Ekanth. The focus first up will be on the pitch and how it behaves. The Netherlands team is out in the middle, led by Scott Edwards. Out come Tanzid Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto, both left-handers. Will that mean we will see the offspin of Aryan Dutt right away? Nope, Netherlands going the traditional way of pace. Vivian Kingma with the new ball. He is over the wicket with a slip in place. Tanzid on strike. <strong>10:36pm</strong>: There are drums being played, dances are on with some folks wearing what looks like a concoction of ribbons. The volunteers are carrying the big folded flags while running out for the anthems. Netherlands' first, it's all instrumental. <em>Amar Shonar Bangla</em> follows. Ashish, who's just done with the toss report, will be in to call the first ball. For the record, 45 minutes have been lost and no overs have been reduced. Sultan: "What is the ground condition in Lauderhill Florida? How long do the groundsmen need to make the field playable after it has rained?" Don't know about ground but a <a href="https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_1280,q_80/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/382700/382751.jpg">picture from Florida</a> suggested it's not good Imtiaz Rabby: "The onside is having a good wind. Tanzid and Shanto will like to have some lofty shots down there." <strong>Bangladesh</strong>: 1 Tanzid Hasan, 2 Litton Das (wk), 3 Najmul Hossain Shanto (capt), 4 Towhid Hridoy, 5 Shakib Al Hasan, 6 Mahmudullah, 7 Jaker Ali, 8 Rishad Hossain, 9 Tanzim Hasan, 10 Taskin Ahmed 11 Mustafizur Rahman <strong>Netherlands</strong>: 1 Michael Levitt, 2 Max O'Dowd, 3 Vikramjit Singh, 4 Sybrand Engelbrecht, 5 Scott Edwards (capt, wk), 6 Bas de Leede, 7 Logan van Beek, 8 Tim Pringle, 9 Aryan Dutt, 10 Paul van Meekeren, 11 Vivian Kingma Shanto says he doesn't mind batting first as it's a good wicket, but they need to careful against the new ball. We're lucky to have a leggie in Rishad. <strong>No changes, same XI</strong> Edwards says not many teams know the conditions here. That they've been playing well and will give themselves every chance. <strong>Aryan Dutt comes in place of Teja Nidamanuru</strong> <strong>10:30am</strong>: Ready for the toss. Richie RIchardson, match referee, is out with Shanto and Edwards. <strong>Netherlands win the toss and will bowl first</strong> Five minutes to go and there's a slight mist. as Hayden says, which is bringing on the Hessian covers. 'We'll get play but not sure when.' is Ali Mitchell's word. As of now, the toss will happen in time. Any changes will be updated here. With the toss countdown reading 3 minutes to go, the captains are ready. 10:21am: <strong>Toss is scheduled at 10:30am, play to start 15 minutes later</strong> Ari: "Someone please clarify this to me. How come SL still has a chance ?" Here's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-scenarios-how-can-pakistan-england-sl-nz-still-qualify-1438051">S Rajesh helping out</a> again and again and again... 10:17am: The covers have been on for a little while. Some of the groundstaff were pouring it out momentarily. It was raining a couple minutes back but is looking much brighter now. And dry. Covers are being removed, well. If this is any indication, we might have to strap in for an unpredictable day. A bit later, the umpires have brief chats with both captains, who are kitted up. Ali Mitchell says the outfield and square have been completely relaid here. <strong>10:02am: Attention Sri Lanka fans, it's started raining all of a sudden and the toss has been delayed.</strong> It's a breezy tropical shower with wind, says Matthew Hayden. Not sure if it's a passing shower or will be one that takes a while to clear up. Either way, updates will be put up here. As we wait, you can check out <strong>Timeout</strong> above. Actually, Hayden says it's getting more intense a couple minutes later. Vikramjit, who was practising, is walking back. Hafiz: "o man, WorriesSLFan: What a jinx!" There were visuals of Shakib Al Hasan practising his batting with neck braces on. Not sure why, we'll find out if he's playing after the toss of course. Sid Monga informs Shakib once did something similar during the ODI World Cup so that the head doesn't fall. <strong>9:50am</strong>: The Netherlands team is synonymous with cohesion. You want to know how a team is better than the sum of its parts? Watch Netherlands. They make scores seem bigger than they are. They cling to the smallest of chances and yank away the false sense of security, which they almost did against South Africa yet again but couldn't in New York. They beat Nepal while playing in front of what was essentially an away crowd that was living every ball to the fullest. They, like Bangladesh, know two straight wins will take them through. A lot hinges in the balance. Toss coming up around 10am local, stay tuned. Harsha: "This ground is right up there with Dharamsala and Cape Town as the most picturesque. " <strong>Pitch report</strong> by Shaun Pollock: We'll get some good carry. It's hard, bit of grass covering. Suggests balls will carry through. I'd bowl first if I won the toss because there isn't much info or games in the recent past. It is likely to be a better pitch than some of the previous ones in the comp. Manu Ajmani: "Netherlands always makes sure to upset one team during the World Cup. Today is their day!" Engr. Md. Mizan: "Plz try to open Rishad . He is the power hitter like as Sunil Narine. Plz try some match opened " WorriedSLFan: "Where is the rain? " <strong>9:40am</strong>: The <strong>weather</strong> is good in Kingstown and is expected to stay that way for the duration of the game.

Tonight is another one of those nights where we can make our nation proud. <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> An 11kph breeze is present. 68m to one side, 61m to the other end. 74m hit straight down the ground, with the longest pocket being 76m. If you are a spinner, this is the venue you want to be at, reckons Samuel Badree. He opines that spinners will enjoy themselves again. There is a bit of patchiness - a few bare areas and a few with grass. Variable bounce might be prevalent and it will be the challenge for the batters. "Spin it to win it", concludes Badree. <b>Nepal XI:</b> Kushal Bhurtel, Aasif Sheikh (wk), Rohit Paudel (c), Anil Sah, Dipendra Singh Airee, Kushal Malla, Gulsan Jha, Sompal Kami, Sundeep Jora, Sandeep Lamichhane, Abinash Bohara <b>Bangladesh XI:</b> Tanzid Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Litton Das (wk), Shakib Al Hasan, Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, Jaker Ali, Rishad Hossain, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman <strong>7pm</strong> It's toss time. Paudel and Shanto are out in the middle. Shanto has the coin and he gives it a spin. Tails calls Paudel and tails it is. <strong>Nepal will bowl first.</strong> Says they want to utilize the conditions and that bowling second will be difficult because of dew. Adds it was disappointing for them to lose the other day but it as professional cricketers, it is about how they come back and they are looking forward to it. A win is important because it will give motivation to everyone in the country and he thanks the fans for their support. <strong>Sundeep Jora comes in for Karan KC. </strong> Shanto says they are very excited and that he is very proud of the boys. <strong>Same eleven for Bangladesh.</strong> <b>6:50pm</b> How many runs do the Netherlands need to win by? How many runs can Bangladesh lose by? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-scenarios-how-can-bangladesh-netherlands-still-qualify-1438051">All answers in this scenarios piece by S Rajesh.</a> Bishal Parajuli: "Nepal may be in infancy when it comes to competing in big boys league, but whenever presented an opportunity, it has showcased its capability to not only crawl and walk alongside its competitors but also outrun them.. Wish Nepal finish this memorable WC campaign on a winning note" <b>6:45pm</b> Mustafizur Rahman has the lowest economy rate in the last four overs, among bowlers to have bowled a minimum of three overs this T20 World Cup. All that and much more in Mohammad Isam's preview, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/bangladesh-vs-nepal-37th-match-group-d-1415737/match-preview">outlining how Nepal can ask Bangladesh some tough questions.</a> <b>6:35pm</b> Nepal were supposed to be miles off South Africa on Friday. But they never felt or thought that way and were, arguably, a foot ahead after 35 overs of cricket, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/nepal-vs-south-africa-31st-match-group-d-1415731/full-scorecard">ultimately falling short of tying the game only by an inch</a>, with a Super Eight spot, which might have been within reach had they won, agonizingly drifting away. Coming so near, yet remaining so far hurts and it would have broken countless Nepalese hearts. However, that outing was also indicative of how strong Nepal are becoming, and how they seem very, very close to the watershed victory their fans deserve and their cricket warrants. That pursuit brings them face to face with Bangladesh in Kingstown. A team that seemed bereft of ideas a month ago, only to start seeing light and solutions since the start of the tournament. They are now just one game away from where they feel they should be at these ICC events: among the elite and with a shot at contesting the games that really matter. As always, though, there is a caveat. If they lose, Bangladesh and their fans might have to rent calculators, mutter prayers and hope for Sri Lanka, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/why-sri-lanka-vs-bangladesh-is-like-large-men-fake-wrestling-each-other-in-too-tight-underpants-1424993">of all teams</a>, to do them a favour. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. Two continental rivals on the grandest global stage. For <b>Bangladesh</b>, a professional (even if slightly boring) win will do; <b>Nepal</b> would want adrenaline pumping their veins again, like it did on Friday, hoping that this time, they can celebrate at the end of it all. Hop on, this should be fun!
