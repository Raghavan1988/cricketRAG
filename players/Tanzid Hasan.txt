So Sri Lanka starting with spin straight away, DDS to open the bowling.

<strong>10.46am</strong> Thanks, Ekanth. The focus first up will be on the pitch and how it behaves. The Netherlands team is out in the middle, led by Scott Edwards. Out come Tanzid Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto, both left-handers. Will that mean we will see the offspin of Aryan Dutt right away? Nope, Netherlands going the traditional way of pace. Vivian Kingma with the new ball. He is over the wicket with a slip in place. Tanzid on strike. <strong>10:36pm</strong>: There are drums being played, dances are on with some folks wearing what looks like a concoction of ribbons. The volunteers are carrying the big folded flags while running out for the anthems. Netherlands' first, it's all instrumental. <em>Amar Shonar Bangla</em> follows. Ashish, who's just done with the toss report, will be in to call the first ball. For the record, 45 minutes have been lost and no overs have been reduced. Sultan: "What is the ground condition in Lauderhill Florida? How long do the groundsmen need to make the field playable after it has rained?" Don't know about ground but a <a href="https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_1280,q_80/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/382700/382751.jpg">picture from Florida</a> suggested it's not good Imtiaz Rabby: "The onside is having a good wind.

That they've been playing well and will give themselves every chance. <strong>Aryan Dutt comes in place of Teja Nidamanuru</strong> <strong>10:30am</strong>: Ready for the toss. Richie RIchardson, match referee, is out with Shanto and Edwards. <strong>Netherlands win the toss and will bowl first</strong> Five minutes to go and there's a slight mist. as Hayden says, which is bringing on the Hessian covers. 'We'll get play but not sure when.' is Ali Mitchell's word. As of now, the toss will happen in time. Any changes will be updated here.

Some of the groundstaff were pouring it out momentarily. It was raining a couple minutes back but is looking much brighter now. And dry. Covers are being removed, well. If this is any indication, we might have to strap in for an unpredictable day. A bit later, the umpires have brief chats with both captains, who are kitted up. Ali Mitchell says the outfield and square have been completely relaid here. <strong>10:02am: Attention Sri Lanka fans, it's started raining all of a sudden and the toss has been delayed.</strong> It's a breezy tropical shower with wind, says Matthew Hayden. Not sure if it's a passing shower or will be one that takes a while to clear up. Either way, updates will be put up here. As we wait, you can check out <strong>Timeout</strong> above. Actually, Hayden says it's getting more intense a couple minutes later. Vikramjit, who was practising, is walking back. Hafiz: "o man, WorriesSLFan: What a jinx!" There were visuals of Shakib Al Hasan practising his batting with neck braces on. Not sure why, we'll find out if he's playing after the toss of course. Sid Monga informs Shakib once did something similar during the ODI World Cup so that the head doesn't fall. <strong>9:50am</strong>: The Netherlands team is synonymous with cohesion. You want to know how a team is better than the sum of its parts? Watch Netherlands. They make scores seem bigger than they are. They cling to the smallest of chances and yank away the false sense of security, which they almost did against South Africa yet again but couldn't in New York. They beat Nepal while playing in front of what was essentially an away crowd that was living every ball to the fullest. They, like Bangladesh, know two straight wins will take them through. A lot hinges in the balance. Toss coming up around 10am local, stay tuned. Harsha: "This ground is right up there with Dharamsala and Cape Town as the most picturesque. " <strong>Pitch report</strong> by Shaun Pollock: We'll get some good carry. It's hard, bit of grass covering. Suggests balls will carry through. I'd bowl first if I won the toss because there isn't much info or games in the recent past. It is likely to be a better pitch than some of the previous ones in the comp. Manu Ajmani: "Netherlands always makes sure to upset one team during the World Cup. Today is their day!" Engr. Md. Mizan: "Plz try to open Rishad . He is the power hitter like as Sunil Narine. Plz try some match opened " WorriedSLFan: "Where is the rain? " <strong>9:40am</strong>: The <strong>weather</strong> is good in Kingstown and is expected to stay that way for the duration of the game. The team batting first will have to work out the nature of the pitch on the job. It is likely to give the team bowling first an advantage. Both teams need to win their remaining games to sail through to the Super Eights without depending on other results. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-scenarios-how-can-pakistan-england-sl-nz-still-qualify-1438051">Full scenarios here</a>. <strong>Match Preview by Mohammad Isam</strong>: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/bangladesh-vs-netherlands-27th-match-group-d-1415727/match-preview">Bangladesh, Netherlands hope for batting boost in Kingstown</a> <strong>9:30am</strong>: The idea of a defensive T20 team has a few features and theories.

All of them seem to apply for a fixture like today's - Bangladesh have three world-class pacers (Taskin, the Fizz, Tanzim), a new leggie with bundles of promise (Rishad). They've brought in Mahmudullah and Jaker to strengthen their batting a the death overs. Shakib needs to find form, which has been tough for him <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-stats-new-york-pitch-a-dream-for-fast-bowlers-a-nightmare-for-batters-1438487">as it has for most batters at New York</a>.

They beat Nepal while playing in front of what was essentially an away crowd that was living every ball to the fullest. They, like Bangladesh, know two straight wins will take them through. A lot hinges in the balance. Toss coming up around 10am local, stay tuned. Harsha: "This ground is right up there with Dharamsala and Cape Town as the most picturesque. " <strong>Pitch report</strong> by Shaun Pollock: We'll get some good carry. It's hard, bit of grass covering. Suggests balls will carry through. I'd bowl first if I won the toss because there isn't much info or games in the recent past. It is likely to be a better pitch than some of the previous ones in the comp. Manu Ajmani: "Netherlands always makes sure to upset one team during the World Cup. Today is their day!" Engr. Md. Mizan: "Plz try to open Rishad . He is the power hitter like as Sunil Narine. Plz try some match opened " WorriedSLFan: "Where is the rain? " <strong>9:40am</strong>: The <strong>weather</strong> is good in Kingstown and is expected to stay that way for the duration of the game. The team batting first will have to work out the nature of the pitch on the job. It is likely to give the team bowling first an advantage. Both teams need to win their remaining games to sail through to the Super Eights without depending on other results. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-scenarios-how-can-pakistan-england-sl-nz-still-qualify-1438051">Full scenarios here</a>. <strong>Match Preview by Mohammad Isam</strong>: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/bangladesh-vs-netherlands-27th-match-group-d-1415727/match-preview">Bangladesh, Netherlands hope for batting boost in Kingstown</a> <strong>9:30am</strong>: The idea of a defensive T20 team has a few features and theories. Being primarily bowling-focused, batters aiming for par scores, that the margin between them and stronger teams reduces when the conditions offer assistance to bowlers. All of them seem to apply for a fixture like today's - Bangladesh have three world-class pacers (Taskin, the Fizz, Tanzim), a new leggie with bundles of promise (Rishad). They've brought in Mahmudullah and Jaker to strengthen their batting a the death overs. Shakib needs to find form, which has been tough for him <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-stats-new-york-pitch-a-dream-for-fast-bowlers-a-nightmare-for-batters-1438487">as it has for most batters at New York</a>. Can they do it on a <strong>fresh pitch with the last international game happening nearly a decade ago</strong>?

Hint of shape into Tanzid but the line is down leg. The ball flicks Tanzid's pads through to the keeper.

Coming so near, yet remaining so far hurts and it would have broken countless Nepalese hearts. However, that outing was also indicative of how strong Nepal are becoming, and how they seem very, very close to the watershed victory their fans deserve and their cricket warrants. That pursuit brings them face to face with Bangladesh in Kingstown. A team that seemed bereft of ideas a month ago, only to start seeing light and solutions since the start of the tournament. They are now just one game away from where they feel they should be at these ICC events: among the elite and with a shot at contesting the games that really matter. As always, though, there is a caveat. If they lose, Bangladesh and their fans might have to rent calculators, mutter prayers and hope for Sri Lanka, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/why-sri-lanka-vs-bangladesh-is-like-large-men-fake-wrestling-each-other-in-too-tight-underpants-1424993">of all teams</a>, to do them a favour. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. Two continental rivals on the grandest global stage. For <b>Bangladesh</b>, a professional (even if slightly boring) win will do; <b>Nepal</b> would want adrenaline pumping their veins again, like it did on Friday, hoping that this time, they can celebrate at the end of it all. Hop on, this should be fun!

Tanzid Hasan c & b Sompal Kami 0 (1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0
<strong>gone first ball! Dream start for Nepal, and their fans are dancing in the aisles!</strong> Banged into the track first up, on middle and leg. Tanzid hares down the track, trying to smash it over mid wicket. The ball rushes onto him, though, and he is awfully late on the stroke. Splices it tamely back to Kami, and he makes no mistake. Bangladesh jolted early!

San T: "This BD team still lack the explosion in the powerplay. In the WC there will sure be some hitting in the first six overs by all the teams as they have at least one batter in the opening pair who will go blazing from the first ball. BD must find that player(s) in the opening pair otherwise in a WC of runs they will fail once again." Tanzid Hasan has the potential to fill that position, but he needs more experience on the international stage. The players are back on the pitch, and the match will shortly resume. <strong>8:45 pm local time:</strong> The covers are taken off. The in-field area is being examined by the umpires.

San T: "This BD team still lack the explosion in the powerplay. In the WC there will sure be some hitting in the first six overs by all the teams as they have at least one batter in the opening pair who will go blazing from the first ball. BD must find that player(s) in the opening pair otherwise in a WC of runs they will fail once again." Tanzid Hasan has the potential to fill that position, but he needs more experience on the international stage. The players are back on the pitch, and the match will shortly resume. <strong>8:45 pm local time:</strong> The covers are taken off. The in-field area is being examined by the umpires.

And for now, that's it. It was a delight to have you guys here, and we appreciate your attendance. Do join the second T20I in ZACS, Chattogram on May 5 at the same time. Take care and stay hydrated in these conditions. Until then, this is Rashad signing off on behalf of Raghav and the rest of the team. <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto:</strong> I think the last couple of days we trained really hard. The way Tanzid batted really helped our team and I hope he will continue his form. (Rain disrupt) It is difficult but we can't control those things but we can control our processes that's why we try. (Hridoy) He batted really well and showed his character on this wicket. Especially I am very happy for Tamim because he finished the innings." <strong>Taskin Ahmed is the Player of the Match:</strong> "Firstly we had a great win today and had a great start with the bowling. We have done the basics well that's why we got the reward. Everyone trained really hard last few weeks and are getting those results. (Support from other bowlers) Each and everyone is working hard to improve themselves. Giving 110% in the training. We had a good match today and we are looking forward to do well in the future as well." <strong>Sikandar Raza:</strong> "I think it is a responsibility for everyone as much as the senior guys would take the blame put our hands up that we got it wrong. The beauty of this team is when we get it right we get it right and everybody do their part but unfortunately today there was a lot of guys missing. Majority of the senior guys on whom the batting relies on unfortunately could not come to the party. But we take those harsh lessons and it's just one game. We are not really proud of the fact that we don't start our tours well but In Sha Allah we will try and make things right then come back better. (Madande and Masakadza) They really did well. We take a lot of pride in still playing the aggressive brand of cricket and I think they did it most part of the innings. Unfortunately we let them play that role which is originally the middle and top order's role. Again a lot of wrongs happened on the start and middle of the order. In Sha Allah we will get there and they will do better for Zimbabwe. (On the depth of the team) We are batting up to 8 now, Jongwe at 8. There are lots of good performances these 8 batters have done in the past. All we need is maybe 4 or 5 guys every game to have that good partnership and good runs on the belt so we can end up on 180-190. (Fielding) We got floodlights on Harare Sporting Club so we need to do practice under the lights. We need to get used to play under the lights but unfortunately we don't get much opportunity to do that. Unfortunately those 3 dropped catches hurt us a lot. Probably things would have been different. It's always the ifs and buts coming in to play with us but I am confident that once we get it right we can beat any team on the day." <strong>Presentation Ceremony:</strong> imtiaz: "Bangladesh team management should focus on how they have preparing for T20 world cup. last time they prepare sluggish pitch and invite NZ and Aus. this time sporting pitch with Zimbabwe. this would do no good in actual tournament." In contrast, Zimbabwe appeared incredibly sloppy and unconfident in the second innings. Litton Das's wicket was their lone success, but other than that, Tanzid Tamim was the star of the show. Few catches were dropped by the fielders, and misfields were frequent. When facing Bangladeshi batters, the bowlers had difficulties finding their line and lengths. The match was won in style by Tanzid Tamim, who scored his first T20I fifty, and Towhid Hridoy, who had a rapid innings following the Tigers' impressive bowling show. Despite being dropped three times by the Zimbabwean fielders, Tanzid continued to play brilliantly and remained unbeaten. The rain caused a few disruptions, but Bangladesh was always in control of the match. <strong>Bangladesh won the match by 8 wickets.</strong>

Ahnaf: "This stint in the last few overs is better, but that still needs to be taken with the context that Tanzid Tamim was dropped three times. There has to be a way out where we don't suffer miserably in the opening overs to have any chance."

And for now, that's it. It was a delight to have you guys here, and we appreciate your attendance. Do join the second T20I in ZACS, Chattogram on May 5 at the same time. Take care and stay hydrated in these conditions. Until then, this is Rashad signing off on behalf of Raghav and the rest of the team. <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto:</strong> I think the last couple of days we trained really hard. The way Tanzid batted really helped our team and I hope he will continue his form. (Rain disrupt) It is difficult but we can't control those things but we can control our processes that's why we try. (Hridoy) He batted really well and showed his character on this wicket. Especially I am very happy for Tamim because he finished the innings." <strong>Taskin Ahmed is the Player of the Match:</strong> "Firstly we had a great win today and had a great start with the bowling. We have done the basics well that's why we got the reward. Everyone trained really hard last few weeks and are getting those results. (Support from other bowlers) Each and everyone is working hard to improve themselves. Giving 110% in the training. We had a good match today and we are looking forward to do well in the future as well." <strong>Sikandar Raza:</strong> "I think it is a responsibility for everyone as much as the senior guys would take the blame put our hands up that we got it wrong. The beauty of this team is when we get it right we get it right and everybody do their part but unfortunately today there was a lot of guys missing. Majority of the senior guys on whom the batting relies on unfortunately could not come to the party. But we take those harsh lessons and it's just one game. We are not really proud of the fact that we don't start our tours well but In Sha Allah we will try and make things right then come back better. (Madande and Masakadza) They really did well. We take a lot of pride in still playing the aggressive brand of cricket and I think they did it most part of the innings. Unfortunately we let them play that role which is originally the middle and top order's role. Again a lot of wrongs happened on the start and middle of the order. In Sha Allah we will get there and they will do better for Zimbabwe. (On the depth of the team) We are batting up to 8 now, Jongwe at 8. There are lots of good performances these 8 batters have done in the past. All we need is maybe 4 or 5 guys every game to have that good partnership and good runs on the belt so we can end up on 180-190. (Fielding) We got floodlights on Harare Sporting Club so we need to do practice under the lights. We need to get used to play under the lights but unfortunately we don't get much opportunity to do that. Unfortunately those 3 dropped catches hurt us a lot. Probably things would have been different. It's always the ifs and buts coming in to play with us but I am confident that once we get it right we can beat any team on the day." <strong>Presentation Ceremony:</strong> imtiaz: "Bangladesh team management should focus on how they have preparing for T20 world cup. last time they prepare sluggish pitch and invite NZ and Aus. this time sporting pitch with Zimbabwe. this would do no good in actual tournament." In contrast, Zimbabwe appeared incredibly sloppy and unconfident in the second innings. Litton Das's wicket was their lone success, but other than that, Tanzid Tamim was the star of the show. Few catches were dropped by the fielders, and misfields were frequent. When facing Bangladeshi batters, the bowlers had difficulties finding their line and lengths. The match was won in style by Tanzid Tamim, who scored his first T20I fifty, and Towhid Hridoy, who had a rapid innings following the Tigers' impressive bowling show. Despite being dropped three times by the Zimbabwean fielders, Tanzid continued to play brilliantly and remained unbeaten. The rain caused a few disruptions, but Bangladesh was always in control of the match. <strong>Bangladesh won the match by 8 wickets.</strong>

Soumya Sarkar and Tanzid Tamim to open the innings for Bangladesh. Sikandar Raza with the new ball, around the wicket, long off and deep mid wicket in place outside the circle.

The galleries are already filling up with people. Ngarava is practicing his bowling next to the centre wicket. Bangladesh, who has already won the series, will now aim to win the remaining two games in order to get off to a solid finish. Their concerns over their batting order are ongoing because Litton Das is having trouble maintaining his form in the white ball format. Rather than depending on two or three middle-order batsmen each game, they would be aiming for a team effort from the batting unit. Their bowling group is playing excellently, and they plan to keep it up. With the addition of Mustafizur Rahman, Soumya Sarkar, and Shakib Al Hasan, a few changes will be expected. The visiting team is still trying to settle into a groove, particularly when it comes to batting and fielding. The management is hoping to strengthen their batting line today since it was unable to hold its own against the Bangladeshi bowlers during the powerplay. They nearly won the last game by batting exceptionally well in the lower middle order, losing by just nine runs. The supporters of Zimbabwe will be really hoping that Ervine, Raza, and other seasoned batters will show up with the bat. <strong>5.10 pm local time:</strong> Hello everyone! Welcome to live coverage of the fourth T20I match between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh on ESPNcricinfo. After completing the Chattogram phase, the final two games of the series will be played in Mirpur, Dhaka. Shere Bangla National Stadium will host today's game. With the beautiful weather forecast for today and no chance of rain, cricket enthusiasts like us will be hoping for an uninterrupted game.

Nitish in, around the wicket to Tanzid Pranali: "A series against USA in USA is the best preparation for the current world cup. It's certainly better than preparing in England - you get to get used to the conditions. Historically ,International touring teams playing their best eleven  would lose against first class teams but that rarely had a bearing on how their series against the home team went."
