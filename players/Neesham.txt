<strong>this has gone so high up and this is going to bring down the clouds with it.

Neesham tries to smoke this into oblivion but only gets elevation. King has to wait an eternity under it, running to his left from extra cover and when it does, he is on top of his game.

That's a poor effort in the field, Saim Ayub should have been sitting deep, he came in and then had to backpedal, that is a clanger. Shrotish angled into middle, lovely pick-up shot and should have been a straightforward catch
