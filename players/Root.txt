pushed through, Root attempts to paddle this off his stumps... and Jadeja is convinced he has him trapped in front! Not given, and England pick up runs, but it doesn't take much to convince Rohit to <b>review</b>. Now, did he hit it? If not, Root could be toast here. Hard to tell if there's a deflection from the initial replay. Long wait for UltraEdge... and when it does arrive, the audio feed is very scratchy. But Marais Erasmus is convinced there was some bottom edge involved, so Root survives and India lose that review

---------------------------- <b>5.21pm:</b> That's all for day two in Rajkot. Thanks for joining us through the day, and we'll be back bright and early tomorrow morning for more. <b>Mark Wood is speaking to TNT Sport:</b> "It's always nice to get wickets. The two at the top were really important and I was really pleased with the Rohit one. He tried to hit it to Ranchi! [Stokes drop?] He said sorry. I normally can't say anything because I'm the worst fielder on the team but now I've got that run-out... [Duckett?] Amazing, and as a bowler, class to watch. It looked like India weren't sure on their fields... amazing to watch. [Knee strapping?] Part and parcel of being a bowler. I hit the deck every third ball so I've probably just got to stay on my feet more." Anup: "England has shown lot of character till date. 1st test turned upside down in 2nd innings, 2nd they fought till the end and now 3rd, the way they approach is very nice, domination from England till now, feels like India is playing in England." Ashish: "@Mark - you are right. If not whitewash, I did expect that India will not be made to fight this much. Kudos to england for that. But also a fact that england have not got the same kind pf pitches which they got last time around. In a way the pitches have helped their batting style and it has been coming off  almost every innings." Bowlesy: "I feel a less talked about effect of Bazball on opposing teams is the scruity it puts the opposition captain under when England are on top with the bat. Do you feel Sharma was not proactive enough in the afternoon?" Mark: "I guess, before the start of the series, that most Indian fans expected a whitewash, but hoped to see a little Bazball as the England ship sunk. Not sure that they expected this much defiance: even in the 2nd Test, there were some nervous moments as England refused to fold tamely." <b>Here's R Ashwin</b>: "It's been quite a long journey. I'd like to dedicate this 500th wicket to my father. He's been through the thick and thin of everything I've done in my life... he's had heart attacks every time I've played. His health has gone for a toss because he's watched games of mine on TV constantly and been a constant support for me. 500 wickets, done and dusted now. [Feeling tired?] The way England are playing, you're not having to bowl a lot of overs. They're showing a lot of intent, giving us less time to think and also less labour... You have to bowl good balls and expect one of those airy-fairy shots to go to hand. [Situation?] I expect this pitch to get really tough to bat, probably on day five. We need to hang in there... The game is hanging in the balance. Some things go our way tomorrow morning and we'll find ourselves dominating. They're putting us under pressure but it's important to respond." <b>5.04pm:</b> Extraordinary batting from England, and from Ben Duckett in particular. An 88-ball century, the second-fastest by an England opener, which has turned an imposing first-innings total compiled across four-and-a-half sessions suddenly seem within reach. Crawley and Pope both contributed too. Not much to write home about for India, particularly with Bumrah seemingly struggling with cramp - though a milestone wicket for R Ashwin, his 500th in Tests.

I'd like to dedicate this 500th wicket to my father. He's been through the thick and thin of everything I've done in my life... he's had heart attacks every time I've played. His health has gone for a toss because he's watched games of mine on TV constantly and been a constant support for me. 500 wickets, done and dusted now. [Feeling tired?] The way England are playing, you're not having to bowl a lot of overs. They're showing a lot of intent, giving us less time to think and also less labour... You have to bowl good balls and expect one of those airy-fairy shots to go to hand. [Situation?] I expect this pitch to get really tough to bat, probably on day five. We need to hang in there... The game is hanging in the balance. Some things go our way tomorrow morning and we'll find ourselves dominating. They're putting us under pressure but it's important to respond." <b>5.04pm:</b> Extraordinary batting from England, and from Ben Duckett in particular. An 88-ball century, the second-fastest by an England opener, which has turned an imposing first-innings total compiled across four-and-a-half sessions suddenly seem within reach. Crawley and Pope both contributed too. Not much to write home about for India, particularly with Bumrah seemingly struggling with cramp - though a milestone wicket for R Ashwin, his 500th in Tests.

<B>Root out against the run of play!</b> And this is a big wicket for India's morale, inside five overs of day three. Root falls prey to his own improvisation, trying to play a reverse scoop/reverse ramp over the slip cordon, but Jaiswal at second slip keeps his eyes on the ball and takes a very tricky catch. This was a full ball just outside off, and Root wanted to make full use of the acres of space at deep third. Wasn't to be and that's England three down!
Not the first time Root has fallen like this. Was out like this against NZ in a Test and also at the ODI World Cup. Keen followers of the game would probably remember a few more such Root dismissals.

Kuldeep to resume. A slip and a short leg in place <strong>12.05pm</strong> Thanks Alan. We are all set for Joe Rot to walk in, and Rohit Sharma to most likely go to Jasprit Bumrah immediately. Kuldeep Yadav has to finish his over first. India drew 39 false responses from England in that session, which is one every four balls. They get belated rewards for it, and now have a new batter in sights. Zak Crawley rode his luck, but played some veautiful shots too. He will be the big wicket
