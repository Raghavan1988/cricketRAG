They're putting us under pressure but it's important to respond." <b>5.04pm:</b> Extraordinary batting from England, and from Ben Duckett in particular. An 88-ball century, the second-fastest by an England opener, which has turned an imposing first-innings total compiled across four-and-a-half sessions suddenly seem within reach. Crawley and Pope both contributed too. Not much to write home about for India, particularly with Bumrah seemingly struggling with cramp - though a milestone wicket for R Ashwin, his 500th in Tests.
