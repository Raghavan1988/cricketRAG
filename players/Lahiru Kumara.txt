<B>Well, well, lovely stuff from Lahiru!</b> Back of a length outside off, Lahiru leans back and just opens the face. Guides it in the air clear of backward point but square enough of third man

back of a length down leg, clips of the thigh pad as Mushfiqur fails to grab this cleanly low to his right. Wide was called initially, but the square leg umpire made a late interjection to correct the call

short and slow outside off, pulls this down to deep midwicket and Kumara's slow turning arc sees him well short on a suicidal second. <B>Sri Lanka are bowled out for 235</b>
<B>2.02pm</b> Play will begin in about 20 minutes, Rashad will be back for that. So don't go too far, we'll be back soon. Findeshi: "It was good to see Bangladeshi players coming and congratulating Liyanage after the last wicket of the srilankan innings. Good to see friendly attitude in the pitch. Hope this good spirit of the game continues between Bangladesh and Srilanka. " Thilina T: "Importance of playing 50 overs! A couple of month back SL could lose all wickets well before 50 overs. Good to see how well they recovered. " --- You don't need to go back months, one week should be enough. But this was a much more resolute display from the tail. Sakib: "Janith played well. But Bangladeshi bowlers did good job as well. SL has scored 39 runs in the last 5 overs, couldn't hit a sixer..." --- Yes, all credit to Bangladesh bowlers. Forced SL into low risk, low reward cricket. Noman: "@49.5 commentary, if Anamul and Jaker Ali collided then how come crashed into Mehidy?" --- Apologies. Took my cue off broadcast commentary, it's been duly corrected now. Jaker was the injured party, Mehidy was uninvolved. <B>13.55pm</b> Sri Lanka then scrambled and clawed themselves up to 235, after languishing at one point on 154 for 7. That was essentially solely down to Janith Liyanage's 102-ball 101, as he shepherded the tail and dragged Sri Lanka to a total they might just about fancy defending. But this was an innings that belonged to the Bangladesh bowlers. The seamers extracted good movement and kept disciplined lines and lengths to pick up regular wickets, while the dryness in the pitch came to the fore later on to make the spinners also a fairly threatening proposition. Sri Lanka didn't do themselves any favours with some lose strokeplay, and a very poor non-review of the in-form Nissanka's lbw, but they will glad for Liyanage's intervention so their bowlers now have something to work with.
