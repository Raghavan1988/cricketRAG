Thanks, Alex! How's everyone doing? Shan Masood and Babar Azam were rebuilding after the openers fell cheaply. Cummins is in red-hot form and appears to be the most threatening among the pacers from both teams. He just claimed the prized scalp of Babar Azam and Pakistan are now in dire straits. Babar continues to struggle and needs to address technical issues to come out of the rut

Short of a length, in the channel, leaves it alone for the keeper to collect

Tossed up, wicket to wicket stuff, shifts his weight back and defends it with a straight bat

Lobbed up on a fuller length on middle and it straightens a touch, neatly played through the line

Problems with the sight-screen, Lyon going back to his bowling mark again. Corner of the sight-screen has some bundles of wires that might be distracting.

Floats it up on fuller length on a quicker pace around the line off, chopped away to point

Bustling in and hammers it on a length, it nips back a touch towards off stump, defended back to the bowler

Good length on the pads, flicked away behind square and took a few steps down the track and was sent back by Masood and rightly so, square leg hunted it down quickly, would have been a terrible botch-up

<strong>Ouch! A nasty lifter </strong>on middle stump line that didn't rise much as he expected! Hostile delivery thumped into the deck and he didn't look comfortable at all, got trapped in the crease and it hit him on the bottom of the grille I reckon. Concussion protocol underway right now. Initially, he was lining up to pull but it just climbed off the deck
Bilal: "Since 1999, it seems a recurring theme Pak loose 3-0 in Aus test. The 1st test is a blowout, the 2nd test Pak shows a fight back and the 3rd test Pak has thrown in the towel early.Will this pattern ever stop." Harry: "This is only the tenth time since the turn of the century that Australia have bowled spin before the 12th over of a Test innings on the opening day of a Test in Australia." Babar Ali: "As a Pakistan-born Australian, I am greatly disappointed in Babar. He is meant to be the shining beacon of hope for all of Pakistan, but so far his performances have not stood the test. I pray he finds form in our final innings. We need him. "

Saud Shakeel is OUT! caught
c †Carey b Cummins
Saud Shakeel c †Carey b Cummins 5 (12b 0x4 0x6 18m) SR: 41.66
<strong>Has he nicked it? Yes, he has and Shakeel has to go! </strong> Short of a length, curving away outside off, was far away from him and he went feeling for it, get a faint tickle through to Carey who pouches it safely in his gloves. Pakistan in deep trouble! That was a tentative prod at the delivery and Cummins keep finding ways to flummox the batters. Looks like he is at the zenith of his career and picking up wickets comes almost instinctively to him at this stage of his career

Shan Masood has been playing an exciting brand of cricket and getting starts, but it would really benefit Pakistan if he could stick around for longer periods and convert those starts into big hundreds. He needs to put a hefty price on his wicket and avoid getting carried away with the go-get-him approach

Back of a length shoulder height delivery on middle, rises with the bounce and tugs it away to deep square
