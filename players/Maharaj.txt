Maharaj has finally caught up. Leaves the full ball with the sharp angle and the crowd quiet up after a noisy little period. He was standing just outside off but didn't get the bat down due to the angle

Keeps it away from the arc to beat him again. Maharaj tries dragging it across with a splashy heave but didn't move across and the reach wasn't enough. Litton is standing wide off side, so this is bowling to a plan
