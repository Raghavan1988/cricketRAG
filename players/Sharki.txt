<strong>nearly a wicket! Dropped!</strong> Though the umpire has given as byes.... Hmmm.... Sounded like a definite noise and deflection as this peach of a delivery from back of a length  seaming in appears to take a deflection off an inside edge that is shelled by Jahangir behind the stumps before going all the way to the rope. If there was no deflection, then it was just good old fashioned very very sharp movement off the seam.
