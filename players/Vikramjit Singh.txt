<strong>1:10pm</strong> The players are out in the middle. Netravalkar with the new ball. Vikramjit and O'Dowd to open the batting for the Netherlands. <strong>1:07pm</strong> Hello and welcome back, folks! USA have four more runs on the board than they did against Nepal a couple of days ago but on what looks like a true batting deck and against the Netherlands, it remains unclear whether that will be enough. The new ball will be key for the USA, considering there was seam movement on offer earlier in the day. All said and done, though, this feels like the Netherlands' game to lose and if USA are to make a fist of things, they will need something special.

Vikramjit Singh is OUT! caught
c Mendis b Shanaka
Vikramjit Singh c Mendis b Shanaka 7 (10b 0x4 0x6 12m) SR: 70
wow! One of the more interesting juggled catches from Kamindu Mendis running in from the deep square leg boundary. This was a short, chest-high ball from Shanaka, which Vikram tries to find a home for in the stands beyond deep square leg. Kamindu makes good ground and gets hands to it, but lets it slip through. But then it hits one thigh, then the other as he is running, and pops back up again for him to snaffle properly
