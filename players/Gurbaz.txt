Thank you, Shashwat. Hello all. South Africa will be tested chasing because it's their less preferred strategy but first Afghanistan need to put some runs up. <strong>1:56pm</strong> The national anthems are done, and we are just minutes away from the start of play now. Can South Africa pick up early wickets and put Afghanistan under pressure? Or will Afghanistan's openers get them off to a good start? Here is Sreshth to take you through the opening salvo. <strong>1:51pm</strong> The players line up for their respective national anthems. The sun is shining, and it looks pretty hot. Sparse crowd so far but those who are in, look excited. The Afghanistan national anthem is up first. Willy: "It's ironic that Afghanistan needs 438, as that was also SA's total in the famous 438 chase against Aus." -- Well, Afghanistan need many more than that, because they need the margin of victory to be 438 runs... Rashid Khan: (On the Australia game) It was a kind of game that was hard to take. As a team, we should be proud of how we have played the tournament. We did not play well in that part when Maxwell was playing but credit goes to him. We have done some great things and we have had some great wins. We want to think about that, and want to focus on what we can do against South Africa today. It is just the beginning for us, winning big games. We will face such games in the future but as a team, it is about staying together collectively. (On the conditions in Ahmedabad) I have played a lot here in the IPL and the wicket is good for batting, but there is some help for the bowlers as well. The pitch is not very different to Mumbai. We should be thinking more about our skills. The challenge is to adjust our skills as soon as possible and we have done it successfully so far this tournament. (Biggest positive from this World Cup) Lots of positives, especially the batting department. We have three or four guys who have scored more than 300 runs. that was one of the goals we had. The batting department taking responsibility, and all of them taking responsibility, I am very happy and proud about it. I was relaxed, sitting in the dressing room and that is down to how the batters have played. <strong>1:40pm</strong> Afghanistan batting first means they are still mathematically in contention for a semi-final spot. A 438-run win is all they need. That aside, it is interesting that both teams have read the surface differently. Afghanistan expect it to slow down, South Africa feel it will skid on better under lights. This also gives South Africa a chance to test their chasing skills, having won just once in three attempts when batting second so far this World Cup. <strong>Afghanistan XI:</strong> Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq <strong>South Africa XI:</strong> Quinton de Kock (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Gerald Coetzee, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi <strong>1:31pm</strong> It's toss time. Bavuma and Shahidi are out in the middle. Bavuma gives it a flick. Shahidi calls heads, and it comes down as heads. <strong>Afghanistan will bat first.</strong> Says that the weather and the surface influenced his decision, expects it to perhaps spin a little more later in the game. <strong>Same team for Afghanistan</strong>. Reflects on the game against Australia, calling it a "tough game" but also understands that they have to move on now, and just think about today. Bavuma says they have not chased well but today is another opportunity to do better. Adds they have had conversations after coming up against a very good Indian team. <strong>Jansen and Shamsi have been rested, with Coetzee and Phehlukwayo coming in</strong>. Differs in his opinion on the surface, and hopes it quickens up later under lights and aids spin in the afternoon. Raj: "Hope SA chose to bowl first if they win the toss.....it will keep Afghanistan's chances of SF qualification alive for another 3 hours. More importantly, it is a chance to test their chasing skills against a very good team." nishant: "What would be the qualification scenario for Afghanistan, if they bat second." -- If Afghanistan bowl first, they will officially be eliminated. <b>As always, LIVE ball-by-ball commentary of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/hindi/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/afghanistan-vs-south-africa-42nd-match-1384433/live-cricket-score">Afghanistan vs South Africa</a> game is available for you in Hindi</b> <b>If you're in the USA, catch the <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/eventCalendarId/100152733/country/us/redirected/true#bucketId=23396">Afghanistan vs South Africa</a> game LIVE on ESPN+</b> Ian: "I'm stupidly excited for this Afghanistan team.

Afghanistan, along with India, are the only two sides yet to concede a score in excess of 300. The Proteas, meanwhile, have breached the 300-run mark on five different occasions. The immovable object against the irresistible force... <strong>1:05pm</strong> Some more information by Firdose Moonda on the eleven that South Africa might probably field today. Andile Phehlukwayo is more than likely to play. He did his visualisation techniques at the pitch and has now joined the others on the practice pitch. Shamsi is also there. ZHM: "Out of curiosity, theoretically at what margin should Afghanistan win to bring their NRR above New Zealand? " -- A 438-run win should do... <strong>12:55pm</strong> Speaking of team combinations, it will be interesting to see how many spinners South Africa go in with. Against India, they opted for Tabraiz Shamsi over Gerald Coetzee. Firdose Moonda, who is at the venue, does tell me that Aiden Markram and Keshav Maharaj are doing quite a bit of bowling during the warm-ups, perhaps a sign that Shamsi might sit this one out, with possibly Coetzee back in the mix. <strong>12:45pm</strong> 20 overs into the second innings in the Afghanistan-Australia game on Tuesday, Afghanistan would have felt their semi-final destiny was very much in their own hands. A little later, when the ball looped up off Glenn Maxwell's top edge towards Mujeeb Ur Rahman at short fine leg, Afghanistan would have felt every single star was aligning for them. Until…it wasn't. Mujeeb spilled that catch. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-glenn-maxwell-stands-tallest-in-adversity-to-deliver-australia-their-knock-out-blow-1407760">Maxwell then unleashed mayhem in Mumbai</a>, and Afghanistan crashed to a three-wicket defeat, despite having Australia 91-7 at one stage. That result, apart from highlighting Maxwell's genius, also took Afghanistan's semi-final fate out of their hands. New Zealand piled further misery on Afghanistan yesterday, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/new-zealand-vs-sri-lanka-41st-match-1384432/full-scorecard">thumping Sri Lanka</a>, meaning that Afghanistan, if they were to bat first today, will need a 400-plus-run margin to overhaul New Zealand's NRR. Mathematically, Afghanistan stand a chance. Realistically, the best they can do is finish on ten points, and hope for a fifth-placed finish in a ten-team World Cup, ahead of the likes of England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. South Africa do not have to worry about any permutations or combinations. They are in the semi-final, and they know who they will face too. The only thing left to be decided is where that semi-final will take place. So, from the outside, it might seem they do not have much to play for. However, they were <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/india-vs-south-africa-37th-match-1384428/full-scorecard">trounced by India on Sunday</a> and the last thing they would want is to head into a semi-final encounter against Australia on the back of two losses. The only blemishes so far in their campaign have come when batting second, and considering they might have to perform that gig in a high-pressure environment soon, devising a proper chasing blueprint could be at the top of their wish-list, along with a few runs for skipper Temba Bavuma. A bit of momentum, just before entering a semi-final against old foes Australia will not hurt them either. This may not be the high-stakes, win-and-take-it-all contest Afghanistan would have thought they had within grasp for much of Tuesday, although they will be longing for one last splash, and another flexing of their World Cup muscle. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of Match 42 between <strong>Afghanistan</strong> and <strong>South Africa</strong>. I am Shashwat Kumar and alongside Sreshth Shah, will bring to you all the action from Ahmedabad. Hop on folks, this promises to be an intriguing game!

Rabada will take the new ball. A change from usual. A length ball around off and Gurbaz is surprised by the bounce.

<strong>7.02pm</strong> Gurbaz isn't too pleased with some lights flashing on the sightscreen. Gurbaz wants it to be sorted. All good to go now. <strong>6.57pm</strong> Hello, again, everyone.

The umpires are wearing gloves to counter the Mohali winter. Captain Zadran will open the batting along with Gurbaz, who has an IPL deal with KKR. Arshdeep Singh has the new ball for India.

It's a T20 World Cup year and the global tournament is less than five months away. Of course there's the IPL, but this is the <em>last</em> T20I series for India before they travel to the USA and the Caribbean for the World Cup. Both Rohit and Kohli are back in India's T20I side, though Kohli is <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-afg-1st-t20i-virat-kohli-to-miss-mohali-t20i-for-personal-reasons-1416183">unavailable</a> for the first game for personal reasons. Afghanistan's ace legspinner Rashid Khan is out of the entire series as he continues to recover from a back surgery, but there's plenty to look forward to. The build-up to the T20 World Cup heats up as India and Afghanistan face each other in chilly Mohali. I'm Deivarayan Muthu and I'll be joined by Sreshth Shah and P Ranjith to bring you all the ball-by-ball action. Stay locked in.

<b>7pm</b> Arshdeep Singh has got the new ball. Rahmanullah Gurbaz to face. One slip. <b>6.55pm</b> Thanks, Himanshu. Thanks to its small boundaries, Indore is usually a high-scoring venue. For this game, the square boundaries are 60 and 63 metres. Down the ground, it is 70 metres. Will we have another high-scoring game? <strong>6.50pm</strong> We are just ten minutes away from the action, as the Indians warm up near one of the boundaries. The crowd looks delighted to be present, as does Hemant, who will take you through Afghanistan's innings. Say hello!

Surath: "I was wondering why Rohit is still playing T20 for India! I got my answer today! 22/4 and yet he kept going after the bowlers even after bagging 2 ducks in a row! He is definitely playing T20 WC this year and will continue to dominate in IPL now he is free from the burden of captaincy! Awesome."

The day their men's team will play its first senior World Cup game (across formats), and nothing will ever take this away from them. Uganda, though, will want more. Maybe something like, dare we say it, a victory. To further adorn this historic moment, and give those back in Uganda a tale to reminisce about for generations and generations. Up against them are Afghanistan, who, rather poetically and perhaps as a beacon of inspiration to Uganda, have been through a similar journey, having undergone the transformation from being outsiders at ICC events to genuine dark horses.  And on the back of last year's ODI World Cup display, they will want to make a mark here. A statement that resonates across the globe and proclaims their readiness to go deep into the T20 World Cup, like their talent and ambition has always threatened. So, here we are. <b>Afghanistan versus Uganda</b>. Two teams that may have slightly different tournament objectives, but two sides whose short-term goals dovetail towards two points. A sojourn of hope, of possibilities, of the pursuit of something tangible for their past experiences for Afghanistan. For Uganda, a first step into promised land. A fantasy foray that is now their reality, and one they hope will be their reality in years to come. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of <b>Match 5</b> of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>.

Toss in 10. <b>7:40pm</b> Uganda have defied several odds to be here at this T20 World Cup. In the African region qualifiers, they got the better of Zimbabwe, and they have faced Afghanistan in the past too. All that and much more in this comprehensive piece by Firdose Moonda, detailing everything you need to know about the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/2024-t20-world-cup-uganda-look-to-leave-an-imprint-on-the-world-stage-1435805">newest African team on the World Cup block.</a> <b>7:30pm</b> <b>June 3, 2024.</b> A red-letter day in Ugandan sporting history. The day their men's team will play its first senior World Cup game (across formats), and nothing will ever take this away from them. Uganda, though, will want more. Maybe something like, dare we say it, a victory. To further adorn this historic moment, and give those back in Uganda a tale to reminisce about for generations and generations. Up against them are Afghanistan, who, rather poetically and perhaps as a beacon of inspiration to Uganda, have been through a similar journey, having undergone the transformation from being outsiders at ICC events to genuine dark horses.  And on the back of last year's ODI World Cup display, they will want to make a mark here. A statement that resonates across the globe and proclaims their readiness to go deep into the T20 World Cup, like their talent and ambition has always threatened. So, here we are. <b>Afghanistan versus Uganda</b>. Two teams that may have slightly different tournament objectives, but two sides whose short-term goals dovetail towards two points. A sojourn of hope, of possibilities, of the pursuit of something tangible for their past experiences for Afghanistan. For Uganda, a first step into promised land. A fantasy foray that is now their reality, and one they hope will be their reality in years to come. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of <b>Match 5</b> of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. The competition has gotten off to a rip-roaring start, and tonight promises to be no different. So, let's get stuck into the action!

<strong>two wickets in quick succession for Uganda!</strong> Tossed up on a length outside off. Gurbaz walks across his stumps, looking for the sweep. Gets a decent chunk of it but not enough to clear deep square leg. Easy catch for the sweeper, and both Afghanistan openers are now back in the shed!

<strong>7:28pm</strong> We are almost in readiness.

The Afghanistan national anthem is up first and will be followed by New Zealand's anthem.

<strong>an event-filled ball!</strong> Full on middle and off. Gurbaz plants his front foot and drills it back into the stumps at the other end. Ibrahim is well out of his crease and Ferguson, sensing this, decides to uproot the stumps. By then, though, Ibrahim gets back via a dive. Had Ferguson got a toe to it on the first go (off Gurbaz's stroke), Ibrahim would have been out! The third umpire wants to check again if the ball scraped Ferguson's boot somehow but Ferguson seemed a little late in jamming his right boot on the floor. And the third umpire agrees with that assessment. Ibrahim stays!

Gurbaz hares down the track and has an agricultural swipe across the line. Misses the ball by a mile and hears the death rattle soon after. The intent was right but the shot and the execution went awfully awry. PNG have another in the powerplay!

Afghanistan have an opportunity to take aim at this chase with no fear, with nothing on the line. Let's see how Gurbaz and Ibrahim start off. Here's Akeal.

Jack: "Just tuned in to check the scores, a bit surprised that the secondary Tolerance Oval is hosting this game. Surprising but I suppose its less costly to host a game there instead" It was a late call. Ireland picked their side thinking this'll be played in the Sheikh Zayed stadium. As Danyal wrote in the preview, a press release later confirmed that the change was because the Sheikh Zayed Stadium will be hosting the Abu Dhabi Schools Sports Championship, between March 1 and 3. <strong>12:01pm, lunch, day 1</strong> Is it even or are Ireland slightly ahead? Three wickets, all from the quicks, but Zadran has motored along. The pitch was expected to help the bowlers in the first hour, Adair surely proved the point by hooping it and nipping it around. The openers were patient but Noor, in a bid to drive through cover, and edged it to slip. Rahmat got a proper seed and Adair had two. The skipper took some time to find the middle of the bat but persisted with driving full balls outside off, a ploy which came through. Zadran was fluent. The stand was looking good until McCarthy strangled Hashmat down leg. The duo in now joined forces and have looked good so far. Both Ireland's spinners have bowled good balls but will look to be more consistent in the afternoon.

Woerkom gets the big one as Gurbaz gone! Lovely arm ball on middle stump, Gurbaz goes back and tries to play on the leg side, misjudged the length of the ball, it went through the gate and hit the middle stump

Mark Adair has the ball. Ring field. Sightscreen needs clearing up. It's taking a couple of minutes. There's a rope/string that's stuck to the side and Ahmed Shah Pakteen goes near the fence to point it out and get it removed. Okay, countdown begins. Two slips in. Let's go. <strong>3:28pm</strong> Six of the last ten matches in Sharjah were won by the chasing team, says Niall O'Brien, as the players walk out. It's bright and sunny out. Gurbaz, on the back of a century, will open with Ibrahim Zadran. They wouldn't mind another 150-run stand. <strong>Pitch report</strong> from Tino Mawoyo: It was pitch no. 4 in the last game and will be the same today. The ball kept low last game and could be the same. The pitch is very dry, the bit of grass and sheen have gone away. Faster bowlers might take pace off and there will be spin. Niall O'Brien says batters will have to look to score down the ground and that they won't have much pace to use. <strong>Paul Stirling, Ireland captain</strong>, would've batted first: We are going to field. We did a number of things pretty well in the last game. The washout has given us a chance to regroup. The series is on the line, so this is a big game for us. Barry McCarthy comes in for Craig Young. M Shinwari: "Good News! New comers are making a way." <strong>Hashmatullah Shahidi, Afghanistan captain</strong>: Wanted to bat first, wicket looks good. We love to win, series on the line here. Pitch looks the same as the first game. There's a bit of wind too. We hope there is no dew and will try our best. Two changes - two debutants in.

<strong>Down the track, lashed back at the bowler, who can't cling on to a real tough return chance</strong>. That was bulleting in just above Woerkom's head, he could only tip the ball over while trying to get his head down and, hence, out the way. Gurbaz got to the pitch and powered it, which probably saved him in the end

<strong>Gurbaz has punched it back to the bowler, drops his bat and has hands on head! He's puzzled</strong>. Hard not to see why. That's as soft as they came. Offbreak on a length, landed outside off and turned back in. It got very little pace off the pitch, Gurbaz went on the back foot and casually tried to work it to long-on. It didn't bounce as much and was a bit too slow, so he spooned it low to the left of McBrine, who dove across and took a good catch. Stirling's bowling change rewarded with a big bonus

Thanks Himanshu. Dilshan Madushanka has the ball. He's going to be bowling at Rahmanullah Gurbaz. All set to go! The action is just about five minutes away, and here comes Fidel to get it started. It's Valentine's Day, and let him know which side you see having the more cosy day. <strong>2.23pm</strong> It is bright and sunny in Pallekele, as Farvez Maharoof calls it a <strong>"much drier pitch"</strong>. He thinks it will be slower too, and that a score of around 270-280 could be enough while batting first. "This match's commentary was supposed to be a solace from all the lovey-dovey couples around me in class, and Oneth had to bring valentine to the chat. Lol" --- There's nowhere to hide or seek solace in, Akindu <strong>Afghanistan</strong>: 1 Rahmanullah Gurbaz, 2 Ibrahim Zadran, 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), 5 Ikram Alikhil (wk), 6 Azmatullah Omarzai, 7 Sharafuddin Ashraf, 8 Mohammad Nabi, 9 Fareed Ahmad, 10 Fazalhaq Farooqi, 11 Qais Ahmad <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>: 1 Avishka Fernando, 2 Pathum Nissanka, 3 Kusal Mendis (capt, wk), 4 Sadeera Samarawickrama, 5 Charith Asalanka, 6 Janith Liyanage, 7 Dunith Wellalage, 8 Akila Dananjaya, 9 Asitha Fernando, 10 Pramod Madushan, 11 Dilshan Madushanka <strong>2.01pm</strong> So the news is that <strong>Afghanistan with the toss and bat first</strong>. Sri Lanka make two changes: <strong>Hasaranga and Theekshana out</strong>, with <strong>Wellalage and Dananjaya in</strong>. Afghanistan, meanwhile, <strong>play Ashraf and Fareed</strong> for Naib and Noor. After play on Sunday, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/charith-asalanka-pitches-for-batting-friendly-tracks-in-sri-lanka-1420800">Asalanka pitched for batting-friendly tracks</a> in Sri Lanka, saying "This is how pitches need to be", with hosts breaching the 300-run mark back-to-back in the series. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/chris-silverwood-our-game-plan-is-better-suited-to-flat-pitches-1420965">Chris Silverwood, Sri Lanka's coach, also highlighted</a> that their "game plan is better suited to flat pitches". "Happy Valentine's Day to everyone and Cricinfo!" --- Thanks Oneth, may our romantic relationship with cricket continue forever In a quick recap of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2nd-odi-1416075/match-report">second ODI</a>, Charith Asalanka hit 97* amid three other half-centuries from the middle order to take Sri Lanka to 308. In reply, Afghanistan were 128 for 1 in the 27th over, before <s>disaster</s> Hasaranga struck. As a result, they slipped and crashed to 153 all out. <strong>1.45pm</strong> Hello and welcome to the third ODI between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. We are in Pallekele again, as the 50-over leg of the tour draws to an end. The hosts have won the series already after victory in the second ODI three days back, so today they have a chance to experiment. The only thing the visitors can take back, meanwhile, is a consolation win, and with it, some confidence ahead of the T20Is. This is Himanshu saying hello ahead of play today, with Fidel set to join the action soon.

a little bit of luck now. This is a back of a length ball on the stumps, and for the first time in the over, Gurbaz is caught on the crease. It takes an inside edge and whizzes away to the fine leg boundary. The fielder there had no chance

fullish and drilled down the ground for four. Gurbaz's foot movement has been precise here. Again, not that bad a ball, but Gurbaz gets a little step down, plays it with the full face, and it goes off the sweetspot past the non-striker's stumps and hits the boundary

Thanks Himanshu. Dilshan Madushanka has the ball. He's going to be bowling at Rahmanullah Gurbaz. All set to go! The action is just about five minutes away, and here comes Fidel to get it started. It's Valentine's Day, and let him know which side you see having the more cosy day. <strong>2.23pm</strong> It is bright and sunny in Pallekele, as Farvez Maharoof calls it a <strong>"much drier pitch"</strong>. He thinks it will be slower too, and that a score of around 270-280 could be enough while batting first. "This match's commentary was supposed to be a solace from all the lovey-dovey couples around me in class, and Oneth had to bring valentine to the chat. Lol" --- There's nowhere to hide or seek solace in, Akindu <strong>Afghanistan</strong>: 1 Rahmanullah Gurbaz, 2 Ibrahim Zadran, 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), 5 Ikram Alikhil (wk), 6 Azmatullah Omarzai, 7 Sharafuddin Ashraf, 8 Mohammad Nabi, 9 Fareed Ahmad, 10 Fazalhaq Farooqi, 11 Qais Ahmad <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>: 1 Avishka Fernando, 2 Pathum Nissanka, 3 Kusal Mendis (capt, wk), 4 Sadeera Samarawickrama, 5 Charith Asalanka, 6 Janith Liyanage, 7 Dunith Wellalage, 8 Akila Dananjaya, 9 Asitha Fernando, 10 Pramod Madushan, 11 Dilshan Madushanka <strong>2.01pm</strong> So the news is that <strong>Afghanistan with the toss and bat first</strong>. Sri Lanka make two changes: <strong>Hasaranga and Theekshana out</strong>, with <strong>Wellalage and Dananjaya in</strong>. Afghanistan, meanwhile, <strong>play Ashraf and Fareed</strong> for Naib and Noor. After play on Sunday, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/charith-asalanka-pitches-for-batting-friendly-tracks-in-sri-lanka-1420800">Asalanka pitched for batting-friendly tracks</a> in Sri Lanka, saying "This is how pitches need to be", with hosts breaching the 300-run mark back-to-back in the series. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/chris-silverwood-our-game-plan-is-better-suited-to-flat-pitches-1420965">Chris Silverwood, Sri Lanka's coach, also highlighted</a> that their "game plan is better suited to flat pitches". "Happy Valentine's Day to everyone and Cricinfo!" --- Thanks Oneth, may our romantic relationship with cricket continue forever In a quick recap of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2nd-odi-1416075/match-report">second ODI</a>, Charith Asalanka hit 97* amid three other half-centuries from the middle order to take Sri Lanka to 308. In reply, Afghanistan were 128 for 1 in the 27th over, before <s>disaster</s> Hasaranga struck. As a result, they slipped and crashed to 153 all out. <strong>1.45pm</strong> Hello and welcome to the third ODI between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. We are in Pallekele again, as the 50-over leg of the tour draws to an end. The hosts have won the series already after victory in the second ODI three days back, so today they have a chance to experiment. The only thing the visitors can take back, meanwhile, is a consolation win, and with it, some confidence ahead of the T20Is. This is Himanshu saying hello ahead of play today, with Fidel set to join the action soon.

<strong>dropped, oh dear!</strong> Dug into the track on leg stump and this rushes onto Gurbaz. He has a swipe at it anyway and splices it. Arrows it towards Dananjaya at deep backward square leg, who makes up ground to his right before putting it down. It hit the tip of his finger, nowhere near the palm

Looks like Gurbaz has done himself a mischief. Calls for the physio straightaway and he does seem in a bit of discomfort. The left leg is what is bothering him. The physio is applying some strapping around Gurbaz's left knee.
