I am Shashwat Kumar and alongside Sreshth Shah, will bring to you all the action from Ahmedabad. Hop on folks, this promises to be an intriguing game!"}]Thank you, Shashwat. Hello all. South Africa will be tested chasing because it's their less preferred strategy but first Afghanistan need to put some runs up. <strong>1:56pm</strong> The national anthems are done, and we are just minutes away from the start of play now. Can South Africa pick up early wickets and put Afghanistan under pressure? Or will Afghanistan's openers get them off to a good start? Here is Sreshth to take you through the opening salvo. <strong>1:51pm</strong> The players line up for their respective national anthems. The sun is shining, and it looks pretty hot. Sparse crowd so far but those who are in, look excited. The Afghanistan national anthem is up first. Willy: "It's ironic that Afghanistan needs 438, as that was also SA's total in the famous 438 chase against Aus." -- Well, Afghanistan need many more than that, because they need the margin of victory to be 438 runs... Rashid Khan: (On the Australia game) It was a kind of game that was hard to take. As a team, we should be proud of how we have played the tournament. We did not play well in that part when Maxwell was playing but credit goes to him. We have done some great things and we have had some great wins. We want to think about that, and want to focus on what we can do against South Africa today. It is just the beginning for us, winning big games. We will face such games in the future but as a team, it is about staying together collectively. (On the conditions in Ahmedabad) I have played a lot here in the IPL and the wicket is good for batting, but there is some help for the bowlers as well. The pitch is not very different to Mumbai. We should be thinking more about our skills. The challenge is to adjust our skills as soon as possible and we have done it successfully so far this tournament. (Biggest positive from this World Cup) Lots of positives, especially the batting department. We have three or four guys who have scored more than 300 runs. that was one of the goals we had. The batting department taking responsibility, and all of them taking responsibility, I am very happy and proud about it. I was relaxed, sitting in the dressing room and that is down to how the batters have played. <strong>1:40pm</strong> Afghanistan batting first means they are still mathematically in contention for a semi-final spot. A 438-run win is all they need. That aside, it is interesting that both teams have read the surface differently. Afghanistan expect it to slow down, South Africa feel it will skid on better under lights. This also gives South Africa a chance to test their chasing skills, having won just once in three attempts when batting second so far this World Cup. <strong>Afghanistan XI:</strong> Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq <strong>South Africa XI:</strong> Quinton de Kock (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Gerald Coetzee, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi <strong>1:31pm</strong> It's toss time. Bavuma and Shahidi are out in the middle. Bavuma gives it a flick. Shahidi calls heads, and it comes down as heads. <strong>Afghanistan will bat first.</strong> Says that the weather and the surface influenced his decision, expects it to perhaps spin a little more later in the game. <strong>Same team for Afghanistan</strong>. Reflects on the game against Australia, calling it a "tough game" but also understands that they have to move on now, and just think about today. Bavuma says they have not chased well but today is another opportunity to do better. Adds they have had conversations after coming up against a very good Indian team. <strong>Jansen and Shamsi have been rested, with Coetzee and Phehlukwayo coming in</strong>. Differs in his opinion on the surface, and hopes it quickens up later under lights and aids spin in the afternoon. Raj: "Hope SA chose to bowl first if they win the toss.....it will keep Afghanistan's chances of SF qualification alive for another 3 hours. More importantly, it is a chance to test their chasing skills against a very good team." nishant: "What would be the qualification scenario for Afghanistan, if they bat second." -- If Afghanistan bowl first, they will officially be eliminated. <b>As always, LIVE ball-by-ball commentary of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/hindi/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/afghanistan-vs-south-africa-42nd-match-1384433/live-cricket-score">Afghanistan vs South Africa</a> game is available for you in Hindi</b> <b>If you're in the USA, catch the <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/eventCalendarId/100152733/country/us/redirected/true#bucketId=23396">Afghanistan vs South Africa</a> game LIVE on ESPN+</b> Ian: "I'm stupidly excited for this Afghanistan team. Can't see them making the semi, but they've been brilliant and I am sure we will see most of these players do even better next time." <strong>1:12pm</strong> Kagiso Rabada has just been presented with a special cap by Shaun Pollock for his 100th ODI appearance. <strong>1:10pm</strong> The outcome of this game, as <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/afghanistan-vs-south-africa-42nd-match-1384433/match-preview">Ashish Pant writes in his preview</a>, could depend on how Afghanistan's bowlers match up against the South African batters. Afghanistan, along with India, are the only two sides yet to concede a score in excess of 300. The Proteas, meanwhile, have breached the 300-run mark on five different occasions. The immovable object against the irresistible force... <strong>1:05pm</strong> Some more information by Firdose Moonda on the eleven that South Africa might probably field today. Andile Phehlukwayo is more than likely to play. He did his visualisation techniques at the pitch and has now joined the others on the practice pitch. Shamsi is also there. ZHM: "Out of curiosity, theoretically at what margin should Afghanistan win to bring their NRR above New Zealand? " -- A 438-run win should do... <strong>12:55pm</strong> Speaking of team combinations, it will be interesting to see how many spinners South Africa go in with. Against India, they opted for Tabraiz Shamsi over Gerald Coetzee. Firdose Moonda, who is at the venue, does tell me that Aiden Markram and Keshav Maharaj are doing quite a bit of bowling during the warm-ups, perhaps a sign that Shamsi might sit this one out, with possibly Coetzee back in the mix. <strong>12:45pm</strong> 20 overs into the second innings in the Afghanistan-Australia game on Tuesday, Afghanistan would have felt their semi-final destiny was very much in their own hands. A little later, when the ball looped up off Glenn Maxwell's top edge towards Mujeeb Ur Rahman at short fine leg, Afghanistan would have felt every single star was aligning for them. Until…it wasn't. Mujeeb spilled that catch. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-glenn-maxwell-stands-tallest-in-adversity-to-deliver-australia-their-knock-out-blow-1407760">Maxwell then unleashed mayhem in Mumbai</a>, and Afghanistan crashed to a three-wicket defeat, despite having Australia 91-7 at one stage. That result, apart from highlighting Maxwell's genius, also took Afghanistan's semi-final fate out of their hands. New Zealand piled further misery on Afghanistan yesterday, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/new-zealand-vs-sri-lanka-41st-match-1384432/full-scorecard">thumping Sri Lanka</a>, meaning that Afghanistan, if they were to bat first today, will need a 400-plus-run margin to overhaul New Zealand's NRR. Mathematically, Afghanistan stand a chance. Realistically, the best they can do is finish on ten points, and hope for a fifth-placed finish in a ten-team World Cup, ahead of the likes of England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. South Africa do not have to worry about any permutations or combinations. They are in the semi-final, and they know who they will face too. The only thing left to be decided is where that semi-final will take place. So, from the outside, it might seem they do not have much to play for. However, they were <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/india-vs-south-africa-37th-match-1384428/full-scorecard">trounced by India on Sunday</a> and the last thing they would want is to head into a semi-final encounter against Australia on the back of two losses.
