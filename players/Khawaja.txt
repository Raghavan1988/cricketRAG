Mark: "The spirit and mateship with which this series has been played is commendable. The Pakistanis giving the Aussie players' kids some Christmas gifts, the SCG crowd standing up to applaud Aamer Jamal, the Pakistani players getting advice off Davey, Uzzy and Smudge, the guard of honour... all of it proves the character of both teams and it's a welcome difference from the tense BGT and Ashes series."

Vin S.: "Two South Asian nations are battling two Southern Hemisphere opponents. First, congratulations to Pakistan for a phenomenal rearguard action and making a solid fist of it against mighty Australia. Second, kudos to India for sending the entire South African team back to the tent for a measly (55) on the scoreboard - shades again of Sri Lanka being all out for (50) runs in Asia Cup 2023, the common Wrecker-in-Chief on both occasions? None other than the inimitable Mohammed Siraj."

<strong>Strangled down the leg side?</strong> Jamal looks convinced and Rizwan goes for the review straightaway; he is sure Khawaja got something on it and the expression on Khawaja's face doesn't look so assured. Short ball zooming in towards leg side and went through very quickly as he tried to help it to fine leg and got a faint tickle through to the keeper, Rizwan makes no mistake and gobbles it up gleefully, he is safe as a house behind the stumps and the entire Pakistan team cluster in joy! On-field umpire reverses his decision as there was a mark close to the glove on that hotspot, strong evidence on snicko as well, big breakthrough. Pakistan get reward for bowling with discipline and creating pressure.

Taz: "Jacques Kallis' batting avg was 22.66 after 10 tests and 40.33 after 30 tests - Green is averaging 33 after 25 tests. Not that Green will likely be Kallis-esque, he is being viewed as someone to grow into a modern good/great batting allrounder. RSA obviously saw something exceptional in Kallis. Aus will give Green similar time to develop." He had Kallis covered after 20 Tests when he made his century in India. But has struggled in six Tests since and people are right to query that form.

That's <b>lunch</b> on the opening day of the first Test. Australia's session. Khawaja and Smith did well to get through the new ball. New Zealand bowled a bit too short. But the home side were lifted by Henry getting Smith. There's help in the surface for the quicks, but Australia have a base now. New Zealand will need to strike quickly in the afternoon session. Abhimanyu will be back with you for the resumption. Meanwhile, you can catch up on the latest episode of <i>Around The Wicket</i> which features special guest Ross Taylor.

Big appeal for lbw. Not given. Has he hit it is the question the fielders are asking. Southee does too, no conclusive answers for him and he decides not to review. Length ball around off, may have straightened a touch. Khawaja was hopping and tried to nudge it leg side. Got a teeny leading edge onto pad, which was enough to save him

Pitched up, Khawaja leans on the extra-cover drive. Wobble ball around fifth, Khawaja using the angle in his favour.
