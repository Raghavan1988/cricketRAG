On Around The Wicket this week, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/michael-clarke-cameron-green-s-game-has-evolved-already-1417093?id=39331243">Michael Clarke discussed Green's return to the side</a>. John: "Good Morning (Night) from Trinidad! Some early wickets before I go to bed will be great!" Fingers crossed for you! Just in case you've missed it, there was an <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/afghanistan-in-india-2023-24-1389384/india-vs-afghanistan-3rd-t20i-1389398/match-report">extraordinary finish to the T20I between India and Afghanistan overnight</a>. <b>9.35am</b> The other main storyline yesterday was another superb display by Australia's quicks (until they forgot to bowl at the stumps to the last-wicket pair!). <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/hazlewood-completes-australias-250-wicket-quartet-in-trademark-style-1416999">Josh Hazlewood joined the 250-club, to mean all Australia's frontliners are now there</a>. <b>9.30am</b> Good morning everyone and welcome to day two from Adelaide Oval. Australia on top, but not by as much as looked likely at one stage yesterday. And that's largely down to one person: debutant Shamar Joseph. What a story he is. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shamar-joseph-on-wicket-of-steven-smith-i-ll-take-a-picture-and-post-it-up-1417001">He spoke brilliantly after the day's play</a>. Gautham Menon: "is it possible to get a list of test bowlers who got a wicket in the first ball of their test careers? or is it too much to ask for." <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/wicket-with-first-ball-in-career-283520">Here you go. He was No. 23</a> Meanwhile, Alex Malcolm is in place and brings this update: "Another cool day in Adelaide with some cloud cover this morning. Come players are wearing jumpers as they warm-up. The Australians were in the nets out the back. Cameron Green was in early getting throws from coach Andrew McDonald. The two dismissed players Steve Smith and Marnus Labsuchagne were also having an early hit while the rest of the batters got themselves organised. Josh Hazlewood said the pitch settled a lot once the hardness went out of the ball yesterday. West Indies will want to make inroads this morning as this ball will be 50 overs old by lunchtime. It would be a surprise if Kraigg Brathwaite didn't start with Shamar Joseph this morning given how well he bowled yesterday."
