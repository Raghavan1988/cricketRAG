The West Indies huddle has broken up, the players heading for their places. Assad Vala and Tony Ura, two PNG veterans, are out in the middle. Looks like Akeal Hosein will open the bowling, slip in place <b>10.28am:</b> Hello, folks. Anthems time at the Guyana National Stadium in Providence. And time for us to "Rally" round the Caribbean (and US of A) for the next few weeks. Should be fun To the contest at hand, PNG have been asked to front up early doors on their second T20 World Cup appearance. The average score batting first here since the start of 2022 is 168, so that should give a measure of what they need to put a powerful West Indies side under pressure in their chase <b>10.20am:</b> Matthew: "C'mon PNG! Spring a nice little surprise early in the tournament!" What an incredible feat that would be.

<strong>8:29pm</strong> We are almost in readiness. Farooqi to take the new ball, like he has done for Afghanistan in each of their previous games. Ura and Vala will open the batting for PNG and neither has set the tournament alight so far. Could tonight be the night? Let's find out! <strong>8:27pm</strong> The national anthems are done and we are now just minutes away from the first ball. Lots to look forward to in this fixture, including a sub-plot between Phil Simmons, PNG's specialist coach and Dwayne Bravo, who is in the Afghanistan camp as their bowling consultant. Both hail from Trinidad and should know a thing or two about the conditions. <strong>8:23pm</strong> The players line up for their respective national anthems. We will have the PNG national anthem first, followed by the Afghanistan anthem. <b>Norman Vanua, PNG pacer</b>: Always an honour to represent (your country). To be the leading wicket-taker, it is an honour. I take it one game at a time. Always a good game against Afghanistan. We have played them in a few T20Is and four-day matches and they are a tough team to beat. We have to play our best game. Cricket has come a long way since I joined and since we last played Afghanistan. The facilities are improving, the grounds are improving and we are getting a lot of support. We are loving it. We are taking the experiences as they come and trying to play our best cricket. We are having fun. <strong>8:15pm</strong> Afghanistan follow what New Zealand did yesterday and will have first use of this pitch with the ball. Farooqi and Naveen will want to get the ball to swing early and make the most of whatever assistance is on offer. PNG, meanwhile, could do with a few runs for their skipper and Tony Ura. <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> Pretty pleasant evening, says Simon Doull. 10-15kph wind, blowing towards the shorter side. 65m to one side, 67m to the other. 74m hit straight down the ground. Daren Ganga reckons it will play similar to last night, although the density of grass around the cracks has increased. He expects there to be a bit more pace on offer. He cites Rutherford's example of taking his time early and using a vertical bat, as opposed to a horizontal bat. <strong>Papua New Guinea XI:</strong> Assad Vala (c), Tony Ura, Sese Bau, Lega Siaka, Hiri Hiri, Kiplin Doriga (wk), Chad Soper, Norman Vanua, Alei Nao, John Kariko, Semo Kamea <strong>Afghanistan XI:</strong> Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Najibullah Zadran, Karim Janat, Rashid Khan (c), Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi <strong>8pm</strong> It's toss time. Rashid Khan and Assad Vala are out there in the middle. Rashid gives the coin a spin. Vala calls heads, and tails it is. <strong>Afghanistan will bowl first.</strong> He says dew could be a factor later on, and they have to be well-prepared, having the mindset to chase as well. Adds that it has been six days but it was a break they needed. They are happy with the break and the team is looking forward to the game. This match is super important and they are taking each game seriously, trying to give 100%. <strong>Same team as the last match. </strong> Vala says the pitch was a little up and down yesterday, although those who spent time in the middle, managed to get the job done. They got back to training three days ago. Says they have gained experience from playing and they want to use that tonight. <strong>One change for PNG - Amini goes out, with Kamea replacing him.</strong> <strong>7:55pm</strong> There was not a lot of pace and bounce on this surface yesterday. With 40 overs already being played on it, will the captain winning the toss be tempted to bat first and put up a score on the board? Toss in 5. Odinlass: "Goooood morning! Very excited for this clash. Hope the weather forecast is in favour of play today." -- Looks like we should not have any problems on the weather front. <b>7:45pm</b> PNG will be supported not just by their fans but also by a host of New Zealand fans. All that and much more in S Sudarshanan's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-papua-new-guinea-29th-match-group-c-1415729/match-preview">preview.</a> Here's an early snippet from Matt Roller, our man at the ground: Took the scenic route to Brian Lara Academy tonight to avoid the rush-hour traffic: an hour's water taxi from Port-of-Spain to San Fernando, then a short journey up from there. My cab driver insisted there would be a big crowd in for Afghanistan vs PNG - "Trinis love a party" - but it's relatively quiet at the moment. Tonight's game will be played on the same strip that was used in last night's between West Indies and New Zealand so expect a relatively low-scoring match if it plays similarly. There's a wind blowing across the ground which could also be a factor. <b>7:30pm</b> <strong>Afghanistan</strong> are almost there. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-papua-new-guinea-29th-match-group-c-1415729/points-table-standings">Almost where they want to be.</a> They can feel it and perhaps even touch it. All they need now is two more points, and the earlier they can accomplish that, the quicker they can put their feet up (momentarily, of course) and plot the road ahead. <strong>Papua New Guinea (PNG)</strong>, on the other hand, have endured a tough second campaign at the men's T20 World Cup. There have been promising moments but have lacked consistency, only staying alive in the competition mathematically. PNG, though, know how difficult it is to just get to the men's T20 World Cup: a sequence of regional qualifiers, battling a variety of conditions and then holding their nerve when it matters. And now that they have opportunity to represent their country, they would want to make the most of this experience. So, PNG will have a rattle at this. Afghanistan could reduce them to a mere footnote in this game. But the prospect of being the team that possibly denies Afghanistan entry to where they want to be, should be enticing enough. If PNG are indeed successful, they will have a piece of history all to themselves, which for those associated with PNG cricket, might be just reward for all the blood, sweat and tears poured in away from the T20 World Cup spotlight. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. It is <b>Afghanistan</b> versus <b>PNG</b>. A win takes Afghanistan through to the Super Eight; a defeat makes things nervier heading into the weekend. Hop on, this should be fun!

To be the leading wicket-taker, it is an honour. I take it one game at a time. Always a good game against Afghanistan. We have played them in a few T20Is and four-day matches and they are a tough team to beat. We have to play our best game. Cricket has come a long way since I joined and since we last played Afghanistan. The facilities are improving, the grounds are improving and we are getting a lot of support. We are loving it. We are taking the experiences as they come and trying to play our best cricket. We are having fun. <strong>8:15pm</strong> Afghanistan follow what New Zealand did yesterday and will have first use of this pitch with the ball. Farooqi and Naveen will want to get the ball to swing early and make the most of whatever assistance is on offer. PNG, meanwhile, could do with a few runs for their skipper and Tony Ura. <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> Pretty pleasant evening, says Simon Doull. 10-15kph wind, blowing towards the shorter side. 65m to one side, 67m to the other. 74m hit straight down the ground. Daren Ganga reckons it will play similar to last night, although the density of grass around the cracks has increased. He expects there to be a bit more pace on offer. He cites Rutherford's example of taking his time early and using a vertical bat, as opposed to a horizontal bat. <strong>Papua New Guinea XI:</strong> Assad Vala (c), Tony Ura, Sese Bau, Lega Siaka, Hiri Hiri, Kiplin Doriga (wk), Chad Soper, Norman Vanua, Alei Nao, John Kariko, Semo Kamea <strong>Afghanistan XI:</strong> Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Najibullah Zadran, Karim Janat, Rashid Khan (c), Noor Ahmad, Naveen-ul-Haq, Fazalhaq Farooqi <strong>8pm</strong> It's toss time. Rashid Khan and Assad Vala are out there in the middle. Rashid gives the coin a spin. Vala calls heads, and tails it is. <strong>Afghanistan will bowl first.</strong> He says dew could be a factor later on, and they have to be well-prepared, having the mindset to chase as well. Adds that it has been six days but it was a break they needed. They are happy with the break and the team is looking forward to the game. This match is super important and they are taking each game seriously, trying to give 100%. <strong>Same team as the last match. </strong> Vala says the pitch was a little up and down yesterday, although those who spent time in the middle, managed to get the job done. They got back to training three days ago. Says they have gained experience from playing and they want to use that tonight. <strong>One change for PNG - Amini goes out, with Kamea replacing him.</strong> <strong>7:55pm</strong> There was not a lot of pace and bounce on this surface yesterday. With 40 overs already being played on it, will the captain winning the toss be tempted to bat first and put up a score on the board? Toss in 5. Odinlass: "Goooood morning! Very excited for this clash. Hope the weather forecast is in favour of play today." -- Looks like we should not have any problems on the weather front. <b>7:45pm</b> PNG will be supported not just by their fans but also by a host of New Zealand fans. All that and much more in S Sudarshanan's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-papua-new-guinea-29th-match-group-c-1415729/match-preview">preview.</a> Here's an early snippet from Matt Roller, our man at the ground: Took the scenic route to Brian Lara Academy tonight to avoid the rush-hour traffic: an hour's water taxi from Port-of-Spain to San Fernando, then a short journey up from there. My cab driver insisted there would be a big crowd in for Afghanistan vs PNG - "Trinis love a party" - but it's relatively quiet at the moment. Tonight's game will be played on the same strip that was used in last night's between West Indies and New Zealand so expect a relatively low-scoring match if it plays similarly. There's a wind blowing across the ground which could also be a factor. <b>7:30pm</b> <strong>Afghanistan</strong> are almost there. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-papua-new-guinea-29th-match-group-c-1415729/points-table-standings">Almost where they want to be.</a> They can feel it and perhaps even touch it. All they need now is two more points, and the earlier they can accomplish that, the quicker they can put their feet up (momentarily, of course) and plot the road ahead. <strong>Papua New Guinea (PNG)</strong>, on the other hand, have endured a tough second campaign at the men's T20 World Cup. There have been promising moments but have lacked consistency, only staying alive in the competition mathematically. PNG, though, know how difficult it is to just get to the men's T20 World Cup: a sequence of regional qualifiers, battling a variety of conditions and then holding their nerve when it matters. And now that they have opportunity to represent their country, they would want to make the most of this experience. So, PNG will have a rattle at this. Afghanistan could reduce them to a mere footnote in this game. But the prospect of being the team that possibly denies Afghanistan entry to where they want to be, should be enticing enough. If PNG are indeed successful, they will have a piece of history all to themselves, which for those associated with PNG cricket, might be just reward for all the blood, sweat and tears poured in away from the T20 World Cup spotlight. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. It is <b>Afghanistan</b> versus <b>PNG</b>. A win takes Afghanistan through to the Super Eight; a defeat makes things nervier heading into the weekend. Hop on, this should be fun!
