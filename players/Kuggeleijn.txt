<strong>straight to deep midwicket! </strong>That's awful batting. Uses his feet, tries to clear the leg side but just offers a simple catch on the fence
Proactive batting is one thing, but surely he had to try and play for Phillips? Matt Henry at No. 9. He has the ability to hang around

<strong>big appeal for lbw!</strong> Sharp spin from outside off, squeezes past the inside edge into the back leg. Probably doing too much

<b>Lol the lbw appeal gets upheld before it was completed.</b> Kuggeleijn reviews. Yorker swinging in at leg stump, 141ks if I read that right. The bat, jamming down, was behind the front leg and the ball hit the inner-half of the front boot. Looked more out on first view but it's good enough as Hawk-Eye shows it'd go on to clip leg stump. Starc's 357th wicket comes in like a bonus for going past Lillee
Drinks. Here's Gnasher to finish off the tail
