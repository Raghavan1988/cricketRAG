Raza is OUT! caught

<strong>Raza gets greedy! But who can blame him going for the scoop with 400 in the crosshairs.</strong> Fullish length on fifth stump, shuffles across his stumps trying to scoop this over fine leg to bring up a half-century and keep the score speeding along in fourth gear but he feathers this through to Monank for a simple catch behind the stumps.
Josh: "Associate players have far less time to train, and far less opportunities to field under pressure (which causes most errors) than full time players." USA's players have all the time in the world to train. Most of them are fully contracted professionals now, have been since 2019 when they got ODI status.

<b>Huge moment in the match!</b> It's a short ball from Campher, rolled his fingers on the side of the ball, almost like a leg cutter, Raza looked for the big pull shot towards the shorter legside boundary, but just doesn't get enough bat on it. Dockrell completes the job at deep square leg.
