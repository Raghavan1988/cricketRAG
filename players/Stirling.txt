<strong>Ibrahim Zadran</strong> The wicket was not easy in the first 10-15. I wanted to take time, not chase every ball. Focus was on watching the ball. I wanted to go longer tbh, I told myself not to throw my wicket. We are in a good position. We will try to get them out early, put good partnerships and a total on the board. <strong>5:32pm, day 1, stumps</strong> Mark Adair and Curtis Campher have put Ireland in front but Zia-ur-Rehman has given Afghanistan an opening. Ireland's openers weren't convincing but Campher got off to a quick start to diffuse the pressure. Moor did struggle but nearly played out the first ten overs, which was when Naveed Zadran was hot. He actually had him bowled off a no-ball. Moor even overturned an lbw call given out on the field as Campher picked up boundaries with fluency. Tector was firm and held up an end, he'll look to convert his start. Zia-ur-Rehman's late jaffas got Campher and the nightwatcher, von Woerkom. Stirling batted out the last few minutes and has a task cut out if the visitors want to push their advantage. The equation - trialling by 55 runs with six wickets in hand - favours them but Afghanistan can cut it short. Join us tomorrow to find out if they can.

<strong>Ibrahim Zadran</strong> The wicket was not easy in the first 10-15. I wanted to take time, not chase every ball. Focus was on watching the ball. I wanted to go longer tbh, I told myself not to throw my wicket. We are in a good position. We will try to get them out early, put good partnerships and a total on the board. <strong>5:32pm, day 1, stumps</strong> Mark Adair and Curtis Campher have put Ireland in front but Zia-ur-Rehman has given Afghanistan an opening. Ireland's openers weren't convincing but Campher got off to a quick start to diffuse the pressure. Moor did struggle but nearly played out the first ten overs, which was when Naveed Zadran was hot. He actually had him bowled off a no-ball. Moor even overturned an lbw call given out on the field as Campher picked up boundaries with fluency. Tector was firm and held up an end, he'll look to convert his start. Zia-ur-Rehman's late jaffas got Campher and the nightwatcher, von Woerkom. Stirling batted out the last few minutes and has a task cut out if the visitors want to push their advantage. The equation - trialling by 55 runs with six wickets in hand - favours them but Afghanistan can cut it short. Join us tomorrow to find out if they can.

Mustafa Moudi: "Ireland really lost the plot form being 92/2 by losing 3 wickets within just 14 Runs. Yes they still highly likely to take a lead but it might be much lesser than what they could have built had they not thrown away their wickets back to back !!" True, but Afghanistan's bowling deserves a lot of credit too. None of the last three wickets were given away really

Pitch Line: OUTSIDE_OFFSTUMP Length: FULL
Shot: COVER_DRIVE
Run scored: 4


Goes fuller on off, he opens the face of the bat and creams it lovingly past cover for a four, got just enough legs to reach the rope even though the rain has slowed it down but that was timed really well, finishes the over on a high and an average over from Amir, struggled to get his radar right

Straying on the pads and paying the price, he puts the loosener where it needed to be put, shorter and just outside leg, he helped it on its way for a four, that's not what Babar would expect from the seasoned campaigner

Slackens his pace and lands it on a shortish length keeping it wicket to wicket, diffidently blocks it back to Amir with soft hands

Paul Stirling c Mohammad Amir b Shaheen Shah Afridi 11 (7b 2x4 0x6 19m) SR: 157.14
Mohammad Amir has taken an absolute <strong>blinder</strong>! Wow! Hits into the pitch on a hard length on a nagging off-stump line, he tried to tonk him down the ground but Amir sprinted across from mid-on and covered a lot of ground to take a superb diving catch. Paul Stirling admonishes himself after miscuing the skier. Big wicket
