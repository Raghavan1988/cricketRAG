Stuck on the crease, missed the ball by a long way... and it is thumping into leg stump! Head has ripped the guts out, SA six down and with a lengthy tail exposed

Jansen flat bats it, hits Maharaj on the bounce as he ran forward, the ball deflects and loses pace. Fielder has to come to mid-off, there's enough time to sneak back for two.
<strong>Tanzim Hasan Sakib</strong>: We saw all matches have been low-scoring in New York. Tried to stick to the basics and that worked. De Kock's wicket was my favourite - he hit me for sixes and I got him which was crucial.  It's always happy, crowd always comes. We appreciate you guys, thank you.

Bangladesh have restricted SA well but Miller and Klaasen have taken the score near par. Still not sure SA batting first after winning the toss was a good idea. Teams today are smart, you'd expect them to know how to play the conditions. They'd know bowlers would just bowl length and let the variability in pace, bounce and lateral movement do its thing. That's what Bangladesh did today. Tanzim started it off, Taskin too was brilliant. The ball to Markram was a beauty, I thought that went straight but Hawk-Eye showed it moved ever so slightly to beat bat. Miller and Klaasen had to bat defensively to ensure they didn't fold. Their run-a-ball 79 stand keeps SA in the hunt, but they couldn't accelerate at the death. Litton used his spinners, Mahmudullah and Rishad, to ensure that didn't happen. Sayan: "This score suggests that people were too harsh on Pak batting." No, they were chasing and could've gotten off in the powerplay. Even SA tried to maximise today but had to hold back because of wickets.
