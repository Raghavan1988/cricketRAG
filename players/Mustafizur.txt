Mustafizur Rahman run out (Paudel/Airee) 3 (4b 0x4 0x6) SR: 75
<strong>a run out to end the innings, and that sums it all up for Bangladesh!</strong> In the slot outside off. Mustafizur sits deep in his crease and drills it straight to extra cover. Taskin calls him through for a non-existent single. Paudel fields it cleanly and then relays it to the bowler, who collects and throws it into the stumps at the bowler's end. <strong>Bangladesh bundled out for 106!</strong>
<strong>9:07pm</strong> Well, that did not go to plan for Bangladesh. They were put into bat and got off to the worst possible start, with Tanzid departing first ball. His questionable shot-selection set the tone and Bangladesh indulged in many such transgressions over the course of their innings. There was a run-out amidst all the carnage, and none of their batters, despite getting starts, could contribute anything of note. Bangladesh's batting was pretty abject but Nepal's bowling was superb. They stuck to their lines and lengths, always targetting the stumps and making the most of the sluggish surface on offer. Airee, Kami, Paudel all bagged two wickets, although Lamichhane was the pick of the bunch, bamboozling batters with his variations. They might have conceded a few too many at the end but they will still feel they have this in control, and that they are just a solid batting display away from registering their first win against a Full Member nation. Join us in a bit for the run-chase! <b>Sompal Kami:</b> It was a fresh wicket, I worked very hard on my planning and very happy with today's performance. (On bowling the third over in the powerplay) He (Rohit Paudel) came and asked me to bowl the third over. Thank you so much Rohit for believing in me (smiles). Wicket is very slow, so we had to use spinners, that is why we used spinners (at the back end also). (On the chase) It will be challenging. We have to play sensible cricket. They are pro players and we have to respect that. We have to watch the ball and play.

Bangladesh lost the first wicket and fell apart like a house of cards, but they were still on course to score a fighting target. Bangladesh lost all their wickets in the space of 42 runs after the opening partnership at 101 runs. Amazing turnaround by the Zimbabwean fielders and bowlers, who claimed three wickets apiece from Jongwe, Ngarava, and Bennett.
