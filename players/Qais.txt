<strong>well taken by Sadeera!</strong> He had to keep his eyes on the ball for a long time - not least under the floodlights - and did well to take it over his head, while almost losing his balance a few steps in the field of play. It was another slower ball from Madushan, and even the line and length were very similar to the previous ball. And so Qais decided to complete the drill by hoicking again, but this time didn't manage to clear long-on
<b>6.04pm</b> Plenty of good starts for Afghanistan, but they are restricted to 266. Rahmat was the top-scorer with 65, with Omarzai hitting 54. But Gurbaz fell for 48, and Alikhil was stopped on 32, as Sri Lanka hit back in the death overs to grab 6 for 43. Madushan led the bowling effort with 3 for 45, even as comeback men Wellalage and Dananjaya combined to pick 4 for 92 from their 20 overs. Stay tuned for the chase, which Fidel will bring to you.
