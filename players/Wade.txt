cuffed hard into the off-side, a good leap to intercept, the shy comes in but Jordan breaks the stumps before he has the ball, then uproots the stump as Wade tries to sneak another... it's academic with the initial run in the bank... but it could technically be an extra wicket. If this was a critical moment, it would be thrilling! Wade's toe was stretching back into the crease, but the stump wasn't completely out of its hole
<B>2.47pm</B> Here's David Warner, whose ballistics in the powerplay kickstarted Australia's total of 201 for 7. "Very competitive, have to take on the first six but the way England brought it back there... we knew there would have been spin up front, but it was about taking the first six on, that's our job. They've got two out-and-out quicks with excellent skill, if you put pressure on them you can get the edge. Jof's offcutter, back of a length, it jumps. You've got to execute." So, England will need the third-highest successful run-chase to win this and get their campaign back on track. It's going to be a tough ask, especially as Australia's bowlers are forewarned about the dangers of pace-on... Alan will be here to kick off the chase shortly.
