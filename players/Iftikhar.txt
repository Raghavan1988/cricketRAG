Iftikhar is OUT! caught
c Arshdeep Singh b Bumrah
Iftikhar Ahmed c Arshdeep Singh b Bumrah 5 (9b 0x4 0x6 14m) SR: 55.55
gone, Bumrah strikes with a full-toss, and Arshdeep takes a terrific catch despite almost running into Suryakumar Yadav! Full-toss angling into the batter, about thigh high, and he swings hard at it while cramped for room. Top-edges it high into the sky, and Arshdeep, from fine leg, and SKY, from deep square leg, converge towards the ball, and almost, almost collide. Arshdeep keeps his eyes locked on the ball and catches it nervelessly
What an over, that. What a bowler.

Shot: PULL
Run scored: 1


Tantalizingly in the air, clouted it towards deep midwicket, two fielders running towards each other and it falls safely between them, Iftikhar only adds one more to the board even though there was an opportunity for another run

<strong>Tonked for SIX! </strong> Touch full and width on offer, he gets down low and clobbers it up and over deep backward point for a maximum. Meaty blow. Not easy to manufacture a six from that position, he was down on one knee but still generated enough power to clear the ropes

Oh, that's a biggee! Right out of the screws, crouches and lifts it up and over deep midwicket and it's gone out of the park. Uses his lumberjack strong wrists to club it into the stands

Smacked over fine leg for a six, not the ideal line, errant delivery down leg, he quickly got down and sashayed across a little on off, gets a top-edge that is enough to send the ball on a trip to the boundary

<strong>Gottim</strong>! On a length and it jags back at middle, Iftikhar pounds it downtown and holes out to long-on. Wanted to finish the game in style but he got more elevation than distance on this occasion, he has been finding fielders at long-on and long-off quite often in the last few games, didn't find the middle on this occasion, Adair continues to have a splendid outing
