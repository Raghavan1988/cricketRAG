Matthew Short c & b Motie 41 (55b 2x4 1x6 64m) SR: 74.54
<strong>Spooned back to the bowler!</strong>. This one might've stuck in the pitch. Shortish ball at the stumps, Short cleared his front leg and tried driving it on top of the bounce with a vertical bat. But the bounce and lack of pace had him splice it back to the bowler. Easy catch for Motie, just reward for good bowling.

Matthew Short c & b Motie 41 (55b 2x4 1x6 64m) SR: 74.54
<strong>Spooned back to the bowler!</strong>. This one might've stuck in the pitch. Shortish ball at the stumps, Short cleared his front leg and tried driving it on top of the bounce with a vertical bat. But the bounce and lack of pace had him splice it back to the bowler. Easy catch for Motie, just reward for good bowling.
Drinks. West Indies are in with a great chance. Can they close this innings out? Find out with Alex

Caleb: "That was a bit of a nothing shot from Smith. Given Australia said that Smith would need to score on this tour to make the World Cup squad, do these two failures mean he won't feature at the World Cup?"
