<strong>3:10pm</strong> The players are out in the middle and the good news, if you are an Ireland fan, is that <strong>Campher is back out</strong>, alongside Tucker. Mavuta to bowl the 26th over. <strong>3:07pm</strong> <strong>Play is about to start imminently, and no overs have been lost.</strong> Just to recap, Ireland need 66 more runs and they have all of 25 overs to do so. Not sure if Campher will return to resume his innings but we will find out soon enough. <strong>3:02pm</strong> The cover that had been placed on the square has come off too. <strong>2:55pm</strong> Good news, folks. <strong>A couple of the big covers have been pulled off and only the one on the square remains now.</strong> "Ireland are so far ahead on DLS that they would be quite happy for it to rain all afternoon and evening." -- They are well ahead in this game, with or without DLS calculations coming into play, Mark. Tom: "What is the DLS score after 25 overs" -- The DLS par score after 25 overs for the loss of three wickets is <strong>74</strong>. <strong>Ireland are 27 runs ahead</strong>, as things stand. <strong>2:40pm</strong> The rain seems to be settling in and the covers are firmly in place. There is a big cover that has been placed on the square and more are being brought on as I type this. <strong>2:36pm</strong> A few spots of rain, and in fact, <strong>the umpires have asked the ground staff to bring on the covers.</strong> Does not look as gloomy as it did a couple of days ago, but we are going off for now. And among all of that, <strong>Campher is being helped off the park by the Ireland physio</strong>. Not sure what happened there but Campher does not look comfortable at all. Looks like he might have pulled a muscle in his lower back while completing the single off the last ball of the 25th over

<strong>Tucker chops on!</strong> Dug in short outside off again. Tucker tries to punch it through the off side but does not go at it with the conviction he usually does. The feet go nowhere either, and that, coupled with the angled bat face, means that he only drags it back onto his stumps. There is still some life left in this game!

<strong>And that will be that! </strong> Full and wide outside off, that's a stunning cover drive that whistles away to the fence, and <strong>Ireland win the series 2-0 </strong>
<b>5:38pm</b>: The Irish players celebrate a superb series win, and that's all we have for you tonight. On behalf of our scorer Harshith and my fellow commentator Abhimanyu, this is Aaditya signing off. Take care, good night! <b>Paul Stirling:</b> I think we've saved our best performance for the last. So happy for the lads. We've worked so hard over the winter, so it's good to have the reward. I never felt like we were too far in the ODI stuff, it was about the little things. The team has performed outstandingly, I just practiced my coin toss in the winter. I'm so proud of the lads, thoroughly deserved. We've got a number of series coming, the T20 World Cup is the first thing that comes to mind. Plenty of cricket coming up. The control with both bat and ball stood out, sometimes that has not been there in the past." <b>Curtis Campher is the Player of the Series</b> "Just really happy to contribute to the team. It was a team decision (to promote him to no.3), the head coach came to me and said this is what we're going to do in the future. Happy to hit the ground running. I'm not thinking about too much, just seeing the ball and hitting the ball." <b>The Player of the Match is Andy Balbirnie</b> "As a top order batter, you're looking for consistency, but know you're one knock away from finding form. So it was good to be out there at the end. The wickets were very difficult. I knew if I set myself up for the back end, I would do well. It's always good to come to Harare. This was probably the best surface out of the three games, was a bit tricky with the lightning around. Credit to our bowlers for restricting them. You can always pinpoint small moments in games, but I think if you bide your time, you get that luck. Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn't. <b>Sikandar Raza:</b>: I thought we were 20-25 runs short on that wicket. We keep doing the same things again and again that's hurting Zimbabwe cricket. It's our job as batters to bat most of the over, and we didn't do again that today. I thought myself and Joylord had a very good partnership. My dismissal came at the wrong. Unfortunately when I got, the floodgates opened, and we never got any partnerships after that. Credit to Ireland for showing us how to play on tricky wickets like that, sometimes we need to graft. It didn't help that we had 8 to 9 guys injured, and some of those are senior players as well. But opportunities present themselves, I just hope the guys can grab those. All I'm praying for is for those 8 to 9 guys to be fit because we're going to need the best squad to go to Sri Lanka. Stick around for a bit for the post-match presentation from Harare <b>5:05pm</b>: What a good win that is for Ireland. <b>That is also their first-ever ODI series win in Zimbabwe</b>. Joylord Gumbie's 72 had taken Zimbabwe to 197 earlier. That always felt a bit below par, but it was certainly a total Zimbabwe could've fought win, and when they dismissed Stirling early, that looked a possibility. But Andrew Balbirnie used all his experience to just hold one end up, even though he was visibily out of form and not striking it too well. He finishes on 82*, Tucker finishes on an enterprising 29*, but the work of the likes of Curtis Campher and Graham Hume with the ball shouldn't go unnoticed. It's been a treacherous couple of months for Zimbabwe now, with the T20 World Cup qualifier defeat now followed by losses in both the T20I and ODI series against Ireland at home.

What about that shot! Slightly short and meandering away outside off, drops his wrists and gets a boundary off a deft touch and Azam is slightly slow to react but he was wrong footed and couldn't get behind the ball, boundary to finish the over, script seems pretty much similar to the last game where every now and then Ireland managed to find a boundary and maintaiend a good scoring rate

Haring in and dug in short outside off, he had an eternity to get into a position where he could easily run it down away from deep third for a four. That cheeky shot also brings up 50 for Ireland. Another brilliant start

Spears it full and wide, Tuckers shuffles across his stumps for a lap but can't quite connect it well enough for a four as the ball trickles away towards short third
SalmanKhan: "Such a no-brainer of using Shaheen Amir in opening burst was messed up by Captain Babar. It took him an eternity to accidentally get it right. Even as a spectator I got confused as what was missing."

Mamoon: "While I understand the fuss about Hassan Ali and his selection, I don't understand why such fuss was not created for Amir. If you look at PSL this year, Hassan was far better than Amir and even better than Shaheen (by no means I am justifying his selection but just highlighting the fact that most of the Pakistani fans comment based on perceptions rather than stats and facts).
