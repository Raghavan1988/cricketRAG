Two slips and a gully now

thick edge along the ground and Smith makes a one handed diving save. Good length, fifth stump, he is squared up on the back foot but the edge goes along the ground
Harry: "There's a forceful aspect to the Babar cover drive that makes it irresistible. Unlike an Ian Bell cover drive, which is like a top product manufactured in the west and assembled in Asia, or a Kohli cover drive, which is workmanlike and mechanical, a Babar cover drive is a whip of fury, a dash of brutal force unchained. Which is enjoyable and in a sense makes it distinctively Pakistani."

Michael Gough thought it was swinging too far but it wasn't. Babar has to go
<strong>Drinks</strong> Huge blow on drinks. Pakistan were rebuilding and Babar looked in great touch. But Cummins does it again from nowhere. Pakistan have lost three in the first hour on a pretty placid surface after winning the toss and batting first. Here is Rvel for the first time today.

<b>steered straight to short third!</b> Archer vents his frustration but he's made the breakthrough for England from the final ball of the powerplay. Slower delivery, sits up as Babar looks to open the face, ends up picking out Rashid on the edge of the ring. Pakistan lose their skipper after a decent start

Cries of catch it but he has got a decent chunk and it goes all the way over long-on! Sinks on his knee and slog sweeps it masterfully into the aisles.
Fahad Abbasi: "The tape ball mindset being reflected here by most of players. Bowlers trying to ball fast with no swing and batters trying to hit six on every ball. Clearly no sense of how to take the game away by playing good  sensible cricket."

Babar Azam c Southee b Sears 66 (43b 7x4 2x6 77m) SR: 153.48
Is that the match? <strong>Sears gets the big fish! </strong>Tries to bash it down the ground but mistimes it straight to Southee at mid-off and is slowly walking off, hard length on off, brilliant innings but would have felt sweeter had he got Pakistan to the doorstep of victory, another timely scalp for New Zealand

And another huuuuuuuuge six, fourth in this over! Tossed up on a length just outside off, rocks back and <strong>clubs it over deep midwicket, that is clean striking. </strong> He has absolutely annihilated Ireland with his power-hitting

<strong>Make it 3!</strong> It's raining sixes from Babar's blade. Slightly shorter and outside off, he shuffles across and blazed over deep square for a mighty long six. Went across his stumps and orchestrated a beautiful six

Excellent timing but the key here is waiting for the ball till the last second so he can place it into the gap. It was short and wide, he cracked it past extra cover for a four, came round the wicket angle but it didn't perturb Azam

Babar Azam c Campher b Young 75 (42b 6x4 5x6 66m) SR: 178.57
Thumped hard into the surface and gets some purchase on a fifth stump line, tries to boom it downtown and holes out to long-on, too little, too late but Babar would be gutted to miss out on an opportunity to stay till the end and finish the game, nevertheless, it's been a remarkable innings from Pakistan captain, started slowly but once he got set, he fired on all cylinders and showed his range
