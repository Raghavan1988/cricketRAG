Rock to face the hat-trick ball. Ireland indeed need a rock, even as there are two slips with Rashid from around the wicket.

it is the googly again, and both the batter and the keeper are beaten! Rashid angled this in on a full length around sixth stump, and got it to turn in to just shave past the outside edge as Rock looked to defend, and also the off stump

<strong>gone, the middle stump is hit!</strong> Kharote offers a casual smile, as Rock is moved. On a length just outside off, and Rock looked to drive from off stump. But the ball turned in and went through the gap between bat and pad. Rock was beaten by the turn, and the ball hit the middle stump

Slung down full and arcing in, cramping him for room, he made his mind to batter it down the ground, picks out long-on and he didn't have to move a muscle to take that catch, couple of wickets in a succession as Ireland to make most of these last six overs, Neil Rock fails to make an impact on his first opportunity in this series
