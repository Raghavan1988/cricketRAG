<strong>another lbw shout, not given again!</strong> Length on middle stump. Decks back sharply and cuts Brits in half. She gets pinned on the front leg again but this seemed to be sliding down leg too. India then indulge in some slack fielding and end up conceding three leg byes

<strong>big appeal, not given!</strong> Fullish, swinging into middle and leg. Brits, after advancing, plays all over it and gets rapped on the back leg. Seemed to be heading down, and India decide against the review

Tazmin Brits b Reddy 5 (11b 1x4 0x6 14m) SR: 45.45
<strong>hot knife through butter, and Reddy roars in delight!</strong> Length ball that starts just outside off before boomeranging back into the batter. Brits is cut in half because the prodigious movement and the ball bursts through the gap between bat and pad. Stumps rattled, and Reddy has a wicket on ODI debut!
