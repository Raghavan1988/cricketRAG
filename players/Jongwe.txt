Jongwe is OUT! caught
c Shayan Jahangir b Paradkar
Luke Jongwe c Shayan Jahangir b Paradkar 1 (3b 0x4 0x6 3m) SR: 33.33
half-volley on seventh stump, flays this flat toward Jahangir at cover sweeper. He comes in off the rope misjudging this before recovering and leaping up high to snatch this before it carries over for six. He lands a yard inside the rope before getting up for a few fist pumps. Theatrical effort but gets the wicket in the end.

Full outside off, driven to Tector at sweeper cover and Zimbabwe finish on 140
<b>2.35pm</b> So Ireland have put in another impressive bowling performance after winning the toss. They have restricted Zimbabwe to 140 and will be confident of chasing it down. Burl and Madande were again the heroes with the bat for Zimbabwe, with another defiant partnership, but this time they couldn't finish the innings and their dismissals probably cost Zimbabwe 10-15 important runs. Brian Bennett's innings would be a positive for Zimbabwe. The youngster failed to fire in his first two international games, but looked much better today before he chopped on off Gareth Delany, who completed a double-wicket over. Join us shortly for the chase!

<B>8.37pm</b> So Zimbabwe take 12 off the final over to get up to 143 for 5. It's a total that owes a huge debt to Sikandar Raza's 42-ball 62, as Sri Lanka's spin twins, Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana, throttled the Zimbabwe innings through the middle. But on a slightly sticky surface that showed signs of some uneven bounce, Zimbabwe will feel they can make this chase fairly uncomfortable for the home side. Join me in about 10 minutes to see how the Lankans fare!
