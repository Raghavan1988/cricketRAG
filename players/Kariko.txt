back of a length outside off. Kariko thinks about playing at it initially before letting it go
A top spell by Noor and he has strengthened his case for a permanent gig, even when Mujeeb is back fit

Kariko joins Nao. Noor goes over the wicket to the left-hander. Slip in place

fires this googly well down leg. Gurbaz cannot gather but short fine leg is on hand to cut it off. Just a solitary extra

<strong>what timing!</strong> Hard length on middle and leg. Kariko gives himself room, opens his bat face and uses the pace to steer it beautifully past backward point!

Kariko is OUT! run out
run out (†Rahmanullah Gurbaz)
Semo Kamea run out (†Rahmanullah Gurbaz) 2 (3b 0x4 0x6 7m) SR: 66.66
<strong>a run-out to end the innings?!</strong> Follows the batter way outside leg. Kariko, because he has no other option, swings wildly at it and misses. Kamea calls him through for a bye. That never looked in the offing and Kamea is caught short of his ground as Gurbaz throws down the stumps. That sums up PNG's innings. They finish with 95 and with four run-outs!
<strong>10:05pm</strong> Another team has failed to breach the 100-run mark against Afghanistan at this year's T20 World Cup. Farooqi set the tone early, with two wickets in his second over, which was preceded by Vala's very avoidable run-out. Naveen then followed up with a peach to dismiss Ura. That firmly broke the back of the PNG innings and they did not help themselves with their calamitous running between the wickets. Afghanistan gave away 25 extras, which was a lot on this surface. That PNG were still unable to get past 100 illustrates how and where it all went wrong. Doriga was the only batter to cross 20 and while he was at the crease alongside Nao, it felt 100 was within reach. He fell to Noor, though, and that meant PNG were ultimately bundled out for 95. This score does not seem enough, even on a surface that has something in it for the bowlers, and it will be a real surprise if Afghanistan cannot get the job done. Join us in a bit for the run-chase! <b>Naveen-ul-Haq:</b> (What getting to 50 T20I wickets means) It is an honour to play for your country and get fifty wickets. Hopefully more to come. Nice, small landmark to achieve at an ICC event. There was a bit of movement so I wanted to pitch the ball up and make the most of the movement. If you see Fazalhaq, he swings the ball, Azmatullah can also bowl (with the new ball). We have spinners as well who can bowl with the new ball. (On the score) Can't say anything about the game. It is a funny game and hopefully we can chase this down.

this is slower and perhaps a touch fuller on leg stump. Kariko goes for the scoop again but does not make contact. Possibly a little early into the stroke

One big hit will take PNG past 100. Can Kariko produce it?
