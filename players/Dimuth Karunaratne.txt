Sri Lanka then will be looking to build on this platform tomorrow and potentially bat Afghanistan out of this game, while the visitors will have to show much more patience and discipline on a surface that is only getting better for the batters. Join us for that, but until then, on behalf of Abhimanyu, Fidel and the team, this is Madushka signing off! <B>5.33pm</b> Sri Lanka end day one then in total control of this Test. Nishan Madushka and Dimuth Karunaratne have absolutely pummelled the Afghan bowlers in the hour and 10 minutes they had to face today, scoring 80 runs in just 14 overs. That means the deficit is now just 118 runs, after Afghanistan had been bowled out midway through the third session for 198. Only Rahmat Shah with 91 played any innings of note, and while there were others who got starts they couldn't go on. There's three wickets apiece for Asitha Fernando and Prabhath Jayasuriya, while Vishwa Fernando grabbed four. Sri Lanka also fielded well throughout the day, exemplified by Sadeera Samarawickrama's clever play to dismiss Shah. Afghanistan by contrast showcased some ill discipline with the ball, rarely testing the Lankan openers, who for their part were quick to pounce on anything lose.

<strong>10am</strong> We look set to go. The players go out to the middle. Karunaratne, eight runs from a half-century, is on strike. Naveed Zadran has the ball in hand. Here is what <strong>Russell Arnold</strong> has to say about the <strong>pitch</strong>: "Green-ness has disappeared, looks like dead grass.  But there is a lot of covering. I really don't think we're going to see too much seam movement. There could be a little more pace and bounce in the pitch, but no cracks - nothing for the spinners to work to. I hate to say it, but it's going to be a boring day in terms of what the bowlers can offer. The batters can make lots of runs. I just feel for the Afghan bowlers along with the heat; what they can try is guile through the air, maybe change of angle. Vishwa Fernando gave a very good example of how to do it. Play boring cricket if you want to get back in the game." <strong>9.55am</strong> Thanks Madushka. Can Afghanistan bowlers find more discipline, and more importantly, more wickets today? Can Karunaratne and Madushka go on to make big scores? We will find out soon! Anyway, in some news for Sri Lanka's Test future, and that in the WTC, they will travel to Bangladesh for <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sl-to-tour-bangladesh-for-two-wtc-matches-in-march-1419396">two Tests in March</a>. On that note, here's Abhimanyu to jump in and take you through the first hour of play. Rakin: "Can SL reach 500 today?" --- Think they'd be ecstatic with that - not sure if a Sri Lanka side has ever scored 400+ in a day - but it only takes a couple of wickets to drop the scoring rate right down. The Afghans will also hope to be a lot more disciplined in their lines and lengths. Akindu: "This game more or less proves why test i the superior form of cricket.The afghan players have great potential but to play atest requires great patience nerve and iron hard will.Sad to see th format dying..." --- Don't know if the format itself is dying, but certainly it's not being made as viable an option for sides outside of the big three. <B>9.40am</b> In terms of the weather, there's some slightly concerning news, with the forecast today predicting a 65% chance of rain in the afternoon. Hopefully that steers clear of the SSC. Akindu: "This may not count for WTC but Srilanka will be hoping for a good start to the yyar 2024 in test. Crucial match this is." Once the Afghan's were bowled out after tea, Sri Lanka's openers had a little over an hour to play out in the final session and they made hay on a surface that had eased up a fair bit by then with the scorching sun beating down on it. They galloped along to 80 in just 14 overs, taking a big chunk out of the deficit in the process. A quick recap of day one then. Afghanistan showed good intent and had promising periods, but eventually they were undone by a lack of staying power against a Sri Lankan attack that showed good patience and perseverance once the movement offered by the new ball had died down. Only Rahmat Shah caused the home side problems, during his 139-ball 91; he was also involved in stands of 57, 52 and 45, but twice his partners faltered before he himself was dismissed courtesy some impressive work behind the stumps by Sadeera Samarawickrama. As Fidel <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-only-test-1416073/match-report">pointed out in his report,</a> aside from Shah only one other batter faced 50 deliveries. <b>9.25am</b> Morning all! Welcome to day two of this inaugural Test between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. It's a 10am start and it'll be Madushka and Abhimanyu keeping you company today, with Fidel at the ground and on the report.

Full outside off, angling in from around the wicket. Karunaratne defends firmly

Sri Lanka also fielded well throughout the day, exemplified by Sadeera Samarawickrama's clever play to dismiss Shah. Afghanistan by contrast showcased some ill discipline with the ball, rarely testing the Lankan openers, who for their part were quick to pounce on anything lose.

<strong>10am</strong> We look set to go. The players go out to the middle. Karunaratne, eight runs from a half-century, is on strike. Naveed Zadran has the ball in hand. Here is what <strong>Russell Arnold</strong> has to say about the <strong>pitch</strong>: "Green-ness has disappeared, looks like dead grass.  But there is a lot of covering. I really don't think we're going to see too much seam movement. There could be a little more pace and bounce in the pitch, but no cracks - nothing for the spinners to work to. I hate to say it, but it's going to be a boring day in terms of what the bowlers can offer. The batters can make lots of runs. I just feel for the Afghan bowlers along with the heat; what they can try is guile through the air, maybe change of angle. Vishwa Fernando gave a very good example of how to do it. Play boring cricket if you want to get back in the game." <strong>9.55am</strong> Thanks Madushka. Can Afghanistan bowlers find more discipline, and more importantly, more wickets today? Can Karunaratne and Madushka go on to make big scores? We will find out soon! Anyway, in some news for Sri Lanka's Test future, and that in the WTC, they will travel to Bangladesh for <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sl-to-tour-bangladesh-for-two-wtc-matches-in-march-1419396">two Tests in March</a>. On that note, here's Abhimanyu to jump in and take you through the first hour of play. Rakin: "Can SL reach 500 today?" --- Think they'd be ecstatic with that - not sure if a Sri Lanka side has ever scored 400+ in a day - but it only takes a couple of wickets to drop the scoring rate right down. The Afghans will also hope to be a lot more disciplined in their lines and lengths. Akindu: "This game more or less proves why test i the superior form of cricket.The afghan players have great potential but to play atest requires great patience nerve and iron hard will.Sad to see th format dying..." --- Don't know if the format itself is dying, but certainly it's not being made as viable an option for sides outside of the big three. <B>9.40am</b> In terms of the weather, there's some slightly concerning news, with the forecast today predicting a 65% chance of rain in the afternoon. Hopefully that steers clear of the SSC. Akindu: "This may not count for WTC but Srilanka will be hoping for a good start to the yyar 2024 in test. Crucial match this is." Once the Afghan's were bowled out after tea, Sri Lanka's openers had a little over an hour to play out in the final session and they made hay on a surface that had eased up a fair bit by then with the scorching sun beating down on it. They galloped along to 80 in just 14 overs, taking a big chunk out of the deficit in the process. A quick recap of day one then. Afghanistan showed good intent and had promising periods, but eventually they were undone by a lack of staying power against a Sri Lankan attack that showed good patience and perseverance once the movement offered by the new ball had died down. Only Rahmat Shah caused the home side problems, during his 139-ball 91; he was also involved in stands of 57, 52 and 45, but twice his partners faltered before he himself was dismissed courtesy some impressive work behind the stumps by Sadeera Samarawickrama. As Fidel <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-only-test-1416073/match-report">pointed out in his report,</a> aside from Shah only one other batter faced 50 deliveries. <b>9.25am</b> Morning all! Welcome to day two of this inaugural Test between Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. It's a 10am start and it'll be Madushka and Abhimanyu keeping you company today, with Fidel at the ground and on the report.

full outside off. Karunaratne skips down and eases it to long on. <strong>And that will also be lunch!</strong>
<strong>12:01pm</strong> Sri Lanka's session, without a shadow of a doubt. 88 runs were scored across 27 overs and that has vindicated their skipper's decision to bat first. There was a bit of help early on and Madushka survived a scare. Post that, though, he has looked composed, registering his second Test fifty in the process. Karunaratne has been stoic at the other end. Like Madushka, he had a slice of luck too, with Shakib dropping him on the fine leg fence. There was a run-out chance that went abegging as well, but he and Sri Lanka will be happy that he has remained unbeaten. Bangladesh's seamers have not gotten as much out of this surface as they did in Sylhet, which, in truth, is an indication of how this pitch is. They did create two openings, however, and will be gutted that both of those went down. Mahmud, on debut, has asked a few questions, with Khaled also not faring badly. The spinners and Taijul, in particular, did get a bit of turn towards the end of the session, and that particular match-up could be key post the break. Madushka will be back in about half an hour to take you through what should be another fascinating session.

Sri Lanka's session in the morning, but Bangladesh did create openings, particularly the seamers - but some lax catching has cost them.

full outside off. Karunaratne skips down and eases it to long on. <strong>And that will also be lunch!</strong>
<strong>12:01pm</strong> Sri Lanka's session, without a shadow of a doubt. 88 runs were scored across 27 overs and that has vindicated their skipper's decision to bat first. There was a bit of help early on and Madushka survived a scare. Post that, though, he has looked composed, registering his second Test fifty in the process. Karunaratne has been stoic at the other end. Like Madushka, he had a slice of luck too, with Shakib dropping him on the fine leg fence. There was a run-out chance that went abegging as well, but he and Sri Lanka will be happy that he has remained unbeaten.
