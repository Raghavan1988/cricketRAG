Another point about Kenjjige coming in now, he and Modani live in Dallas and are effectively training partners as the only two players in the USA squad from the city. So they have good chemistry together and play in the same local franchise side.

Drinks taken. Karan KC has bowled a gutsy seven-over new ball spell to wipe out all but Modani from USA's top order. USA is badly missing their captain Monank Patel, who is out today with a stomach bug and is cooped up in his room at the team hotel. Nepal is short a pace bowling option with Sompal Kami out today. How they would have loved him to partner Karan KC with the new ball in these conditions where there has been plenty of sideways movement on offer that USA has been unable to deal with. Can USA climb out of this hole with Gajanand at the crease coming off his century against West Indies from two days ago? Here's Ashish Pant to take over the comms for the next session of play.
