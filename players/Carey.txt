On a length well outside off, 126.3kph, Carey lets it go. It goes on the bounce to Da Silva, who dives and pouches that. <b>Lunch, day two!</b>
<strong>12:04pm</strong> West Indies have not allowed Australia to run away with the Test, even though the hosts have gnawed at the trail - the figure reads 44. Shamar began from where he left it last evening. Struck in his opening over to dismiss Green. Got good support from Alzarri for much of the first hour. There was a risk of Australia running away with the change bowlers in operation. But Greaves snaffled Khawaja, who was in sights of another fifty, before Roach got in with Marsh's dismissal. Enticingly poised as Head has hung around, despite not looking all too convincing. Which pretty much sums his career of late. Lots to look forward to in the second session. Join Gnasher for the resumption in about half an hour. Dave: "Interestingly, the highest score in the match by a right handed batsman in the match so far is Kemar Roach's 17 runs. Only left handed batters have passed 20. Perhaps Davey Warner should have played one more... or, maybe, Renshaw?"
