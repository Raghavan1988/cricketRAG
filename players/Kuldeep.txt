c Hendricks b Maharaj
Kuldeep Yadav c Hendricks b Maharaj 1 (5b 0x4 0x6 9m) SR: 20
<strong>soft, soft dismissal!</strong> Gives it plenty of air outside off and Kuldeep thinks he can swipe this away. Reaches out for it with his sweep but he just does not have any pace to work with. The ball bounces a smidgen extra too and loops up off the top edge. Hendricks does the rest at backward square leg, and India are seven down now!
