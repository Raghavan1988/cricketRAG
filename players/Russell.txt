Sam Curran on for what should be the last over (ball?) of the innings...

Yep, one ball. Short, wide, <strong>Russell carves gloriously over backward point</strong> and West Indies win by 4 wickets with 11 deliveries to spare. That's now the highest successful chase at this ground and surely a player of the match gong on its way to Russell after his career-best 3 for 19 prior to this finishing cameo
<strong>10.20pm</strong> Right, that's all from us tonight. Join us on Thursday for the 2nd T20i in Grenada! <strong>10.19pm</strong> Jos Buttler, not for the first time on this trip, is scrabbling for some positives by way of lessons to learn. "From the position we were in, we were looking for a score of 200," he says, after England relinquished a strong position of 77 for no loss at the end of the Power Play before falling to 171 all out with three deliveries to go in their innings. "We want to keep pushing the boundaries and trying to be as positive as we can. But it's about finding ways to keep scoring in that manner. Getting those extra 20, 25 runs in an unfashionable way." <strong>10.15pm</strong> As expected, Andre Russell is your player of the match: "Life is so funny. Since when I got selected for the West Indies team I've dreaming from two weeks now. I was dreaming of being man of the match."

That's all from us tonight, thanks for your company - and make sure to keep an eye out for Cameron Ponsonby's analysis from the ground. On behalf of Alan and Binoy, this is Matt Roller signing off. Time for the presentations. <b>Phil Salt is Player of the Match</b>: "I'm definitely enjoying it. It's a cool place to tour. The boys have produced the goods in the last couple of games and now we've got a decider to look forward to. It's very satisfying. The tweaks that I've made to my game in the last six months from a mental approach point of view... it's good that I'm seeing the rewards now. Myself and Motty spoke after the last game and he said it's a habit. After the first few overs, they bowled quite well at us, and then it evened out. At the five or six over mark, it was probably at that point we realised we could put them under pressure. They're a very good side. The way their lads strike the ball, you never know what someone like Dre Russ is capable of. It's not often Jos gives the gloves, normally he's hogging them..." <b>Rovman Powell:</b> "Credit where credit is due. Phil Salt and Jos batted really well up front. These things happen. It's a very thin line, we're playing against world-class players. Once you don't execute properly, they're going to put you under pressure. The boys like a final it seems. We'll come into Thursday with brand new ideas and plans... The guys will just relax. Sometimes you just need to give them some space. It's a thinking game, and once guys are clear in their mind, they generally can execute." <b>Jos Buttler:</b> "A fantastic win. You don't play in too many of those games. It was like being at the Hong Kong Sixes! Really proud of the group, to play with the bravery, the courage and the skill level that we have. Really enjoyable partnership with [Phil Salt]. We've done it in the Hundred and with Lancashire. Just wanted to get a different perspective as captain... see how it goes. I don't mind either - not sure it makes too much difference either way. I think both teams have played some really good cricket. Great to be going into the last game of the tour at 2-2." <b>7.07pm:</b> T20 cricket - you've got to love it. 459 runs, 33 sixes and a second consecutive century from Phil Salt to give England a 75-run win in Tarouba, posting their highest-ever score in this format before bowling West Indies out in the 16th over of the chase. West Indies kept up with the required rate for most of their innings, but regular wickets meant they never stood a realistic chance. Wickets shared around this evening, with all six England bowlers in the book. This is the first-ever bilateral men's T20I series to have witnessed <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=3;filter=advanced;groupby=series;orderby=sixes;template=results;tournament_type=2;type=batting">more than 100 sixes</a>... and there's still Thursday's decider to come.

<strong>just a bye to end the innings!</strong> Gets the wide yorker right and Russell cannot make contact. Perhaps a little late in jamming his bat down, and WI have to settle for a bye off the last ball
<strong>10:06pm</strong> West Indies could not quite hit top gear with the bat, but Russell's cameo has ensured that they have more than 170 on the board. Prior to that, Pooran and Powell were enterprising for their cameos. Rutherford also made 22 off 16. Charles spent the longest amount of time at the crease but could not get going at all, scratching his way to 44 off 42. They will still be happy with this total, although they will feel they left a few runs out there. A massive chunk of that was down to how well Uganda bowled in the back half. Their yorkers were largely on point and it was only in the last over where the runs flowed. Masaba, before their death-bowling display, tied the West Indies down with his variations. Ramjani and Nakrani was also impressive, although it was surprising to see the pair not completing their respective quotas. While there were promising bits through their bowling innings, there is no denying that Uganda have a steep chase in front of them. But if they are to get there, we will have seen one of the greatest upsets at the T20 World Cup. Join us in a bit for the run-chase! <b>Johnson Charles:</b> It feels good (to score some runs). Guyana is always a tough pitch. I felt I really had to give something for the team. I think we have a decent total on the board. Once we nail our lengths, we have a decent chance. I wanted to make use of the first six (overs). I wanted to open up the off side but their pacers bowled well, sticking to their plans. The pitch did not really bounce. I think we have enough on the board, as long as we hit our lengths.

<strong>Rashid grasses Russell</strong>, West Indies finish on 218 for 5. Hard length from Naveen, Russell looks to smack it over deep midwicket but gets more height than distance. Rashid covers good ground to his right from long-on but fails to hang on
Not all doom and gloom for Afghanistan, though. They have a very good batting line-up, albeit a touch untested in this competition. With nothing to lose, there cannot be a better occasion for them to join the party. And if they do, Sreshth Shah will have a fun time calling it. Stay tuned. <strong>10:13pm Highest total for West Indies in men's T20 World Cups</strong> and their batters come to the party. Scored heavily in the first five overs and the last five - the most in these phases where ball-by-ball records are available, the middle ten bringing them just 63. This is a good batting track, but it is a formidable score. It was that man Pooran again, putting a big-hitting masterclass against pace and spin. It was helped in part by West Indies getting a superb start with King and Charles getting off the blocks quickly. Nothing highlights the batters' dominance today more than the fact that Farooqi, the leading wicket-taker of T20 World Cup 2024, did not complete his quota. He was never allowed to settle and as a result, most of Afghanistan's bowling plans came undone. Siva: "Looking at deep explosive batting order I feel Afghans have done a decent job in keeping WI at 218. Knowing their temperament to challenge, they will definitely go at it hard !!" Praveen Kumar: "I was looking at the table and fixtures and cricinfo had already decided yesterday  that WI is going to win this game because they have placed AFG in the India and AUS group. Oracle eyes!!!" The seedings were pre-decided, which is why there is nothing at stake in this match Sowmya : "19.4 The only way he could have got out. A piece of brilliance on the field.
