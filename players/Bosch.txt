Umpire Ananthapadmanabhan has been spot-on with his decisions so far this innings

<strong>gorgeous drive to get off the mark!</strong> Full enough just outside off and that is all Bosch needs. Springs forward, presents the full face and caresses it back past the bowler!

Bosch is the new batter in. A bit of a delay because one of the bails has seemingly malfunctioned

<strong>massive appeal, but the umpire is unmoved!</strong> Full and shaping into middle and leg. Bosch plays all over her flick and gets rapped on the pads. India deliberate but do not review. Was it sliding down again? Replays indicate that might have been the case. Good decision to not go upstairs

<strong>goes straight up, and Deepti gets the breakthrough India were after!</strong> Tosses it up outside off and entices the big stroke. Bosch hares down the track, looking to smash it over Deepti's head. Loses shape and cuts across it too much. Rodrigues settles under it at extra cover and makes no mistake!
