<b>swings leg side but picks out the man!</b> Woakes can't time his cross-batted heave and it's a good running, tumbling catch by Hetmyer to see him off. This has been a superb over from Holder so far to bring victory in sight for West Indies

speared in from round the wicket, clipped firmly but straight at midwicket. One run and one wicket in the 17th, and 3 for 24 all told. Priceless!
Rob: "So the spinners bowl straight and England can barely get the ball off the park. Pathetic, brainless slogging is all our T20 "specialists" can do. WIndies will knock this off in the powerplay." Let's see what England's spin twins have to say... they'll need a bit more to bowl at though

full length, heavy ball, tapped without much intent to the on-side. A super spell from Thomas, and England are in a significant hole
Even two good overs from here is barely 160. 150 feels the realistic limit

<strong>Yorker from round the wicket!</strong> Straight through Woakes' defences, into the base of the stumps, and England will do well to reach 140 now!
Alan: "This looks pretty inadequate for England, what's par on this re-used pitch?" Hard to judge given how far removed it seems from Tuesday's road. But 160 feels competitive. Anything less is advantage Windies
