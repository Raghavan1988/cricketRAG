Abbott strikes in his first over after starring with the bat, nicks off Ottley with a fullish ball outside off. He went for an expansive drive through cover. Ball landed around fourth and angled away, found the edge along the way to the keeper. Four balls on a back of length followed by a full one does the trick

<strong>given lbw!</strong> Ottley has a chat to his partner. But no review. He walks off. Full and shaping back into middle, Ottley <strong>got a huge inside edge!</strong> He hit his pad just before so maybe he thought he hit his pad. That would/should have been not out. It was a massive deflection off the inside edge!
