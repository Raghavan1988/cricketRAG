Luus is OUT! caught
c †Ghosh b Mandhana
Sune Luus c †Ghosh b Mandhana 12 (13b 2x4 0x6 8m) SR: 92.3
<strong>Mandhana has a wicket, and look at her go! A massive cheer from the crowd, and Luus cannot believe what she has done!</strong> Back of a length outside off. Seems to bounce a tad extra and that causes the dismissal. Luus looks to cut it away but the bounce means that the ball kisses the outside edge and nestles into Ghosh's gloves!

Oh, hello. Mandhana to bowl now, and the crowd erupts Venki: "The sooner India can get Wolvaardt, the easier they can rest. Let's not forget that Wolvaardt came into this series fresh off an epic 184*." -- And a 110* against the same opposition. She definitely holds the key in this run-chase
