<strong>great work from Sanju, fires a direct hit at the non-striker's end!</strong> Gulbadin looks to slog, gets an inside edge that rolls wide of the keeper on the leg side. Janat was halfway down the pitch when he was sent back, Sanju ran in quickly, picked up the ball and fired the throw in one motion and hit bull's eye.

<strong>it's a tie and we're going into a Super Over!</strong> Mukesh bowls a wide yorker that Gulbadin scythes through the infield to deep cover, Rinku lobs a throw on the bounce to Sanju but it's so far away from the stumps that it gives the batter the split second to make his ground even as Sanju tries to deflect the throw onto the stumps. <b> A better throw from Rinku could've made a difference. </b>. What a finish! And we're not done yet.
<b>10.38pm </b> What a game we've had. India are huddled together to decide who bowls. All of them have been taken for plenty. Washington's been the best bowler by a mile. Do they take a chance by bowling him against two set batters? Surely Nabi should come out to open with Gulbadin? This was meant to be a dead rubber, but it's bern a thrill-a-minute ride that has had everyone on the edge of their seats for the last half hour. Exhilarating stuff. As disappointed as he will be with the bowling effort, Rohit won't really mind this experience of playing in a Super Over. The question is who bowls. We'll find out soon.

Goes through the line and pumps it over the bowler's head. A seven-wicket win to further assert their dominance and Afghanistan have been full value for this win!
<strong>11:55pm</strong> That will be all from us for this game. Afghanistan are into the Super Eight and they take their place alongside India and Australia, with Bangladesh looking most likely to join them in that group. Another learning curve for PNG, meanwhile, and they will be back at it in a couple of days' time, taking on New Zealand, who also suffered tonight with Afghanistan winning. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. There is more T20 World Cup action lined up in about eleven hours from now, and we would love your company for that game too. Until next time, this is goodbye from me, Ranjith, Vairavan and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care, folks! <b>Rashid Khan, Afghanistan captain:</b> Feeling great to qualify for the next round. First time for Afghanistan being in Super Eight in T20Is. The boys have done well, adjusting to the conditions very quickly and that is something very pleasing for me. It is very important to have someone like him (Farooqi), and it helps you later as well if you get a couple of wickets. The more you attack when there is help for you, the better it is for you. Even if the batter is attacking, you have to attack as well. We are lucky to have him in our side. (On Afghanistan's middle order) We are happy the way the openers played in the first two games. But middle order is all in form and they just need more time. Sometimes, it is hard in T20s when you have just 15-18 balls. It is hard to hit from ball one in these conditions. In the domestic competition, they were also scoring runs. If they get more opportunities, they will perform and give their best for the team. (On now travelling to St. Lucia) That is the beauty of playing franchise cricket, you have an idea about the wicket. Most of the guys, like Nabi, Gurbaz played in St. Lucia and we have to share that experience with the guys who have not played much (there). It is about playing your natural cricket in those conditions. We will not change our brand of cricket, and it is about how we will play that brand in those conditions. Everyone has that ability to adjust to the conditions quickly and hopefully we will have a good game there as well. <b>Assad Vala, Papua New Guinea captain:</b> They are a really good bowling team and to give them four easy wickets with four run-outs, especially my run-out, that was a bit lazy. (On assessing the conditions) It has been challenging for every team. We spoke about trying to give ourselves a chance and then launch at the end, something we learnt from Rutherford the other day. We could not execute unfortunately but they bowled well too. I am really happy with the way the bowlers have been going. We have not put up enough runs for them to defend. The execution of their skills and their planning has been really good. Ale has been good with the new ball, Kamea bowled beautifully. We created a few opportunities but we could not hold on. It is a challenge, getting the exposure against quality quick bowlers. We do not face these bowlers in Associate cricket. <b>Fazalhaq Farooqi, Player of the Match:</b> I want to congratulate the entire team because we have now officially qualified (for the Super Eight). I feel proud. Before the warm-up match, I was in the IPL. I did not get any chances there unfortunately. I played just one warm-up game. I know how to carry my body and I just tried to keep it simple. I try to get some wickets if there is some movement or swing. If there is nothing, then I try to go to plan B, not go for boundaries and keep it simple. We have to give our 100% and we will try our best to do it in the last match as well. (On Rashid trying to interrupt him during this interview) He is trying to make me laugh but I am not laughing (smiles). <strong>11:32pm</strong> Afghanistan and the West Indies. The two teams that will be going through from Group C into the Super Eight. After their respective performances against New Zealand, that seemed the likely outcome and Afghanistan, at the first time of asking, set that in stone. This chase turned out to be a lot trickier than they would have anticipated. However, they will be happy that their middle order spent some time out in the middle, even thwarting off a bit of early PNG pressure. Naib walked in to bat in the second over and was there at the end, remaining unbeaten on 49. He took his time at the start but showcased his full range of strokes as his knock progressed. Omarzai and Nabi also played useful cameos, and that ensured Afghanistan got past the finish line comfortably. As for PNG, they showed a lot of heart and fight with the ball. Their bowlers gave it their all but they just did not have enough runs on the board. Kamea, Nao and Vanua picked up a wicket each, although they will go back to their hotel rooms tonight thinking what could have been had they put up a few more runs on the board.

Hasaranga appeals for lbw, and given! Naib is almost surprised at this decision, though. Full ball on middle, dipping on to the batter while turning in a bit. Yup, there was an inside edge, as replays confirm, with Naib looking to defend the ball. But the decision went in Hasaranga's favour, and the day is done
So Sri Lanka wrap the series with an unbeatable 2-0 lead following a massive 155-run win tonight. That didn't look even remotely possible when Afghanistan's second-wicket pair was ticking along steadily. But Hasaranga weaved his magic, and brought Sri Lanka back amid a scarcely-believable slide for the visitors. <s>Madushanka</s> <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2nd-odi-1416075/match-report">Madushka's report</a> is up, as we bid you goodbye for today!

As far as the third ODI is concerned, there could be a few changes." <strong>Hashmatullah Shahidi</strong> speaks now: "Mood is not good for everyone. This had happened in the second innings [of the Test too]. Our top order did really well, but the ball was gripping for Hasaranga. Looking at the wicket and the conditions, we were positive, and were thinking of chasing it down. Top order did well. The fielding was not good; we have away chances. [There were] nearly four drops. Fielding is important, and you also have to think about the bowling, where we have to be more disciplined." <strong>Charith Asalanka is the Player of the Match</strong> for his 97* off 74 balls: "It's always challenging when I'm batting at No. 5 because I don't know what time I have to bat... Janith [and I] had a chat to carry the innings till the 40th over. Firstly, I was looking at 270-280. [But] when Janith was batting [that way], I thought it could [even] be 320. I was trying harder from the 47th over, but I couldn't get as much as I tried." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> And inevitably, the collapse has brought our <strong>statsman Sampath</strong> into action. He says, "Afghanistan's 153 is the third-lowest men's ODI total where two batters scored fifties. Kenya's 142 vs Sri Lanka in the 2011 WC, and Scotland's 142 vs New Zealand in the 2015 CWC are the lowest" Mausique Ahmed: "It is called a 'classic' collapse" <strong>9.28pm</strong> Afghanistan lose 9 for 25 in just above seven overs. Nine for 25. Incredible. This comes barely two days after they threatened to cause a great upset, a game which was sandwiched between this one and the Test where they had also lost their last nine wickets in a hurry. This evening, Rahmat scored 63, and Ibrahim got 54. The next highest score from an Afghanistan batter was 9. Hang around for the presentations.

<strong>Afghanistan lose their fourth inside the powerplay!</strong> Beautifully-disguised slower ball on a length outside off. Naib looks at the length and thinks he can cash in. He has no clue about the variation, though, and plays too early. Lobs it up to Hasaranga at mid on, who back-pedals and snaffles up a smart overhead chance!
