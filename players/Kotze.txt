<strong>And now it's a brilliant start!</strong> Shorter length, into the pitch - which slows it down a touch - and Kotze cloths a pull shot straight to midwicket

<b>2.56pm:</b> Greetings all. Hello? Is anyone here?? Typical. Anyway, the players are all lined up for the anthems. Play set to get underway in a bit. Yes, I've also got an eye on the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/united-states-of-america-vs-pakistan-11th-match-group-a-1415711/live-cricket-score">events in Dallas</a>, if you were wondering... <B>2.44pm</B> The important news is the weather. It looks like a much lighter day than we've had previously, still a touch overcast but fingers crossed, no rain looming on the horizon. Vithushan Ehantharajah will be here shortly to take you through the first innings. <B>2.38pm</B> There's a breeze coming in from the south-east, which is the short side of the ground, only 58 metres, so do you take it on? The pitches in Barbados have offered inconsistent bounce on a good length, but who knows how it will play? They used the same track for the first two games, and the par score doubled. <B>Namibia win the toss and bat</B> Gerhard Erasmus: "It's going to be slow conditions all round, we have the right set-up to win the game batting first. The formula changes a little, gives us the freedom to play rather than just chase. We want to sharpen up from Oman, sluggish in the second half of the game. A great rivalry in the Associate world, we've been lucky to be on the winning side in the T20 format." Same side for Namibia, and for Scotland Richie Berrington might have batted first, but "right lengths on this wicket can be tricky to score. Hopefully have a good start with the ball. The guys in the middle did well against England but today's a new day. Since we arrived in Caribbean, each ground has been slightly different, a day-game today might be different. Play with our plans." <B>Namibia:</B> 1 Michael van Lingen, 2 Nikolaas Davin, 3 Jan Frylinck, 4 Gerhard Erasmus (capt), 5 JJ Smit, 6 David Wiese, 7 Zane Green (wk), 8 Malan Kruger, 9 Ruben Trumpelmann, 10 Bernard Scholtz, 11 Tangeni Lungameni Brad Wheal to opening the bowling for Scotland, with JP Kotze facing up... <B>Scotland:</B> 1 George Munsey, 2 Michael Jones, 3 Brandon McMullen, 4 Richie Berrington (capt), 5 Matt Cross (wk), 6 Michael Leask, 7 Chris Greaves, 8 Mark Watt, 9 Brad Wheal, 10 Chris Sole, 11 Brad Currie <B>2.30pm</B> Right, it's toss time.

One of Scotland or Namibia could take a significant stride towards qualification with victory at Kensington Oval today ... but who will it be, and will the weather play ball? All will be revealed soon enough. The toss is looming in roughly an hour's time. For the meantime though, the action is all happening over the way in Dallas.

Full, swinging in... not out. Almost the perfect start, but not enough swing to bring the ball into the stumps. Great start from Wheal to the left-hander
