there's that Axar slider going with that big inward angle from wide of the crease. Goes on the back foot, presumably looking to play through the off side, and it hurries on with the angle and he hurriedly jams his bat down. Can't connect, and it beats the inside edge to hit the back pad. Huge lbw appeal, not given, and <strong>India have reviewed</strong>... It's struck him in front of middle stump, he's on the back foot, the ball doesn't have a long way to go, and HawkEye says it's crashing into a good chunk of leg stump. Axar has struck first ball!!!

Bowls a wrong'un that comes slowly off the surface towards off, once again cutting and finding fielder in the ring

Usman Khan c Bracewell b Sodhi 31 (24b 3x4 1x6 32m) SR: 129.16
Helds a nifty low catch! Pakistan were cruising along and have lost wicket just at the wrong time, Usman prances down the track to manufacture his own length and spoons it to Michael Bracewell at extra cover, he looks despondent after that error of judgement, looked on-song today, missed out on an opportunity to score a big knock but a significant improvement but he put up a good exhibition of eye-catching shots

Tossed up with plenty of flight and keeps it wide outside off, , gets low, brings the broom out, reaches out and drags it across the line towards midwicket

Zips it quicker on a length at off, clears his front leg and smothers the spin with a pull towards midwicket, fruitful over for Pakistan

Around, drops it short on middle, <strong>clonked </strong>onto the on-side, no need to run for that, he took a step back and hammered a pull in front of midwicket, absolutely leathered it

Looped from around the wicket, just outside leg stump, swivel aerial pull that swirls away from Sodhi at deep fine leg, that's more like you play T20, like the aggression and uninhibited approach

Didn't get the middle but such is the power of the man that he still manages to clear the fence, once again skedaddles down the track and larrups it over long-off, adjusted well in the end, not off the middle though
