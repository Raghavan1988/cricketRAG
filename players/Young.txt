Karl: "@Neil: Who knows - Michael Hussey made his test debut at 30 and fashioned a succesful test career. I suppose the difference is that playing for NZ, Young gets limited opportunities to play tests and has less of a chance to make a significant impact, given that time isn't on his side. He certainly has potential though!"

"As a Kiwi casting about for positives being inserted on a green wicket...Can I dare to dream that this may venture into 'not a bad toss to lose' territory?Wicket looks a tad spongy, not genuine overhead swing conditions, Kiwi batters looking intent on their movements. Should be really good batting conditions in about an hour's time.(At least I can dream until we're 4 down at lunch)" Tough work being a fan, eh, Hamish?
