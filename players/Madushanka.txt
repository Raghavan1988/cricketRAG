Asalanka with a terrific century and Samarawickrama and Mendis with useful forties were the batting highlights. Ngarava's cramp-laden spell was impressive, his two early wickets giving Zimbabwe the early advantage. The debutant offspinner Mufudza was tidy with an economy of 3.7. Raza excellent too with 1-41.
