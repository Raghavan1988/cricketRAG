shin high full toss. Hammered to long on and they will finish with two runs. <B>Sri Lanka finish on 273 for 9</b>
<B>6.17pm</b> What do we have here? Both teams will be happy, both teams shall be disappointed. Its just that kind of total. Sri Lanka would've wanted to get closer to 280-290 while Zimbabwe would think they could've restricted the hosts to 250. Asalanka with a terrific century and Samarawickrama and Mendis with useful forties were the batting highlights. Ngarava's cramp-laden spell was impressive, his two early wickets giving Zimbabwe the early advantage. The debutant offspinner Mufudza was tidy with an economy of 3.7. Raza excellent too with 1-41. We shall be back with the chase soon.

waist-high full toss. Hammered high up in the night sky and lands safe at cow corner. But no ball not given! Umpire Wharf signals that the ball was dipping.

<B>And that's that!</b> Tanzib, who had made his way back on to the field, finishes off the innings with a splendid bit of work at backward point. Madushanka looks to hack this away onside but gets a leading edge that looks to be looping over Tanzib, but he leaps with two hand and grabs this excellently
Harsh : "Bangladesh bowled exceptionally well to restrict Sri Lanka to 255 otherwise the way they were playing at some stage, 300 was on the cards for Sri Lanka." --- Their fielding and execution of plans was also top notch today. Forced several Lankan batters out of their comfort zones. Sammy: "What happened to the bowler that did the hattrick last t20i? Did Sri Lanka dropped him." --- Nuwan Thushara is mainly for T20s at the moment, Sammy. Don't think Sri Lanka will want to play him too much outside of that with a World Cup so close by. Nalin: "The old SL is back. So pathetic. Specially Mendis should take the blame. After getting to 50 everyday he throws it away. If he stayed till 40th over SL would have easily score 280 . But Mendis never learns. So many 50s and very less 100s." --- Have to disagree, Nalin. This was more a failure of execution rather than anything systemic that you might have seen with the "old SL". Necessary growing pains in trying to play more expansive cricket. Also felt it was a calculated risk by Mendis to go after the bowling before the field was spread out after the 40th. While the execution was lacking, think his idea was correct - particularly as 300 should have been the minimum target on this surface. Also a lot of credit to Bangladesh for their plans and execution. <B>6.08pm</b> Sri Lanka bowled out for 255 in 48.5 overs then as Bangladesh will be absolutely chuffed with their performance with the ball and in the field. Sri Lanka though will rue some wasted opportunities. They started off excellently with 71-run opening stand, but then lost three in quick succession. Several batters got starts, but none were able to carry on and do any real damage - particularly on a pretty good batting surface. The three seamers, Tanzim, Shoriful and Taskin each picked up three a piece to do a bulk of the damage, but credit should also go to Mehidy Hasan Miraz, whose tidy and tight 10 overs went for just 33 runs and a wicket to boot. Janith Liyanage and Kusal Mendis did well to rebuild, but the latter's first attempt at upping the scoring around the 35th over resulted in his demise and from that point on Sri Lanka struggled to put together any momentum. Once Hasaranga also fell shortly after it was left for Liyanage to bat with the tail, and scramble together as much as possible - which wasn't all that much in the end as it turned out. Join me in about 35 minutes for the start of the chase.
