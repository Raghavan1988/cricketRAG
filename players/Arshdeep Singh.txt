did that carry? Doesn't matter, because Rizwan hasn't held on. And it's hurt Arshdeep. Cross-seam bouncer, and Arshdeep gets into an awkward, cramped position while trying to hook. Jams his right glove into his bat handle, and then loops up behind the wicket, teasingly. Rizwan has to throw himself forward to try and catch it, and I don't think it carried. Can't catch it on the bounce either

Amir to finish off. Left-arm over. Din: "No disrespect to Pak, but I don't see they chasing anything above 130 in this pitch against Bumrah and co bowling. " -- 130 is still quite a way away...

Arshdeep heaves one away. Length ball slanting in towards off stump, and he just stands there, opens up his hips, and clubs it away over wide mid-on. Doesn't quite nail it, and it lands and slows down in the outfield, but enough impetus on the ball to pick up four
