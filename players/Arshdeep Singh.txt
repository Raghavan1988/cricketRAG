<strong>7.34pm</strong> Here comes the confirmation: <strong>South Africa need 152 to win</strong>. With the match reduced to 15 overs, the powerplay will be of five overs only.

Coetzee on a hat-trick. Hang on, looks like none of that's going to happen with the steady drizzle threatening enough for the players to go off. <b>The covers are on</b>. And this might as well signal the end of India's innings. India lost both their openers for a duck, but Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav made they kept the momentum adding 49 off 24 balls for the third wicket. Suryakumar and Rinku then added 70 off 48 with both batters getting to their individual fifties. The South Africa bowlers were all over the place with their lengths and the batters cashed in. Himanshu will be with you, once the match restarts.
