<b>12.15pm:</b> Pakistan will be happy with their work. Or will they? Always hard to tell with them... Certainly, a chase of 107 to beat Ireland shouldn't daunt their batting order, but the conditions in Lauderhill don't look straightforward. If Ireland's seamers can nibble out a couple early, things could get interesting. Shashank will be back for that shortly Here's Shaheen Afridi on Pakistan's bowling effort: "As usual, I'm trying to strike early on, follow my plans and bowl fuller. If you take wickets in the first two overs, your opponents are under pressure. We did a very good job as a bowling unit. [Chase] New ball might be tricky but [we should get there, seems to be the gist]."
