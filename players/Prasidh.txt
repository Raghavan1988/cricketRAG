<b>It's all over. India have lost their last six wickets without adding another run</b>. Full outside off. Mukesh hangs his bat out, gets an outside edge and Markram from second slip pouches another, diving across to his left and getting both hands to it
ROhit: "6 ducks in India's scorecard. Certainly a record?" --- Yes, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/most-ducks-in-an-innings-283040">the joint-most</a> <b>3.58pm</b> Just 11 deliveries ago, India were 153 for 4 with a lead of 98. Ngidi, who had leaked 30 from five overs until then, changed the complexion with a three-wicket maiden. Kohli watched all that from the non-striker's end. On the second ball of the next over, he too departed, with Rabada inducing an outside edge. Siraj was run-out two balls later, and Rabada wrapped up the innings with the subsequent delivery. It's the first ever instance of six wickets falling on the same score in a Test, says Sampath. The first two innings lasted only 349 balls, <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;groupby=match;innings_number=1;innings_number=2;orderby=balls;orderbyad=reverse;qualmin1=2;qualval1=team_innings;size=200;template=results;type=team">the second-fewest</a> ever in Test cricket.
