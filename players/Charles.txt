<strong>huge lbw appeal given not out.</strong> Australia <strong>review</strong>. Wade thinks umpire's call hitting leg "at worst. Full inswinging yorker, misses the inside edge and hits the back leg in front of leg stump. Was it missing? Ball tracking projection says ... clipping leg! Umpire's call. Wade was right. Australia keep the review. Charles remains not out.

Another edge, another four. Charles makes room by backing away slightly early. Omarzai lands it on a length around off and middle, and swings it away. He goes hard at that and gets a thick outside edge to the left of short third this time

Azmatullah Omarzai to share the new ball. A slip and short third for him too, apart from the deep backward point

<strong>Edge, thanks to the outswing!</strong> Charles gets away and gets four. Full and well outside off, he has a tentative poke at that. Fortunately for him, the outside edge flies away from short third and is wide enough for backward point to get to

<B>Drilled back down!</b> Full and straight in line of the stumps, Charles never bothers to get his front foot towards the pitch of the ball. Keeps an open stance and belts it between the non-striker and mid-on. Matt Roller had written about <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-wi-vs-afg-time-for-johnson-charles-to-put-on-a-show-1439101">the time for Charles to shine</a>, and at a venue where he has a stand named after him, he sure is putting on a show.

Smartly done this time. Farooqi goes for the change-up and bowls a slower one full outside off. Charles plays the check shot, opening the face of the bat to get it between backward point and short third. The protection deep is on the leg side

A third four for Charles via the outside edge. Angling away on a length at 131.4kph, the width was too enticing to let go of. Charles goes hard at it away from his body again, gets a thick outside edge that beats backward point rushing to his left
