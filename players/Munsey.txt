<B>11.22am:</B> England are all smiles as they take to the middle. Whatever tension was evident in Jos Buttler's pre-match media comments has dissipated for now. Out come the Scotland openers to face the music. George Munsey and Durham's Michael Jones, with Wood to take the first over, with a stiff breeze on his back at the Malcolm Marshall End, swirling up from the south. Ishan Jain: "In addition to the freshness associate teams bring in their skills, it's even more refreshing to see their styles. Absolutely love Scotland team's jerseys." It is a belter, I grant you. <B>11.17am:</B> This is showing signs of being an event now. Out come the teams for the anthems. Past the World Cup trophy too, which of course is still England's to lose for now... Flower of Scotland first... and now God Save The King. Saifi: "Yes England should not go with Jof for each game before super 8 but hey, haven't we all, including Eng team, been waiting to see him in action! Why should we wait anymore for his deadly dangerous bowling!" I think holding him back from playing in front of his Barbados friends and family would have been an act of cruelty. But yes, if England can make a winning start, there may be an opportunity to rest him for later clashes. Pranali: "Surely everyone complaining about the leaf blower can get their home country boards to donate a more acceptable device?" A hovercraft? There might be one of Allen Stanford's helicopters in storage somewhere ... no, wait, he rented them... <B>11.16am:</B> Should England be cautious with Jofra Archer? The Timeout crew have had their say. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/should-england-be-cautious-with-jofra-archer-1436735">Watch it here </a> <B>11.07am:</B> Right, greetings. Let's get stuck in. Incidentally, there are 90 mins of extra time factored in for morning matches, so still some time in the bank before overs lost in case there's another delay. This leaf-blower / sponge farce reminds me of a delay in Antigua at the 2007 World Cup, when the outfield seemed to be mopped up by torn-up pieces of sofa. Whatever works, I guess. Faust Grenaldo: "If there is a significant delay before play starts, does Scotland have the option to change their toss decision since conditions would have changed?" Nope... and I suspect they might have buyer's remorse shortly when Jofra and Wood ping one off that damp patch... Meanwhile, amid all this thumb-twiddling, let's find out who won the toss in today's other match, Netherlands vs Nepal over in Dallas <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/netherlands-vs-nepal-7th-match-group-d-1415707/live-cricket-score">... oh...</a> <b>11.06am:</b> Right, let's do this again - we're set for a <b>11:25am start (4:25pm BST)</b> with no overs lost. Hairdryer must have done the trick! And with that, over to Andrew Miller <b>10.54am:</b> Oh for... the covers haven't quite done their job - there is a wet patch on a good length. There's going to be another inspection at 11:15am local time (4:15pm BST), but I'm not entirely sure how that is going to dry by then, unless someone's got a hairdryer on them. Jos Buttler's out there having a look, as are Matthew Cross and Richie Berrington. Eeeek. <b>10.45am:</b> Mark S: "I finish work at 4pm UK time, so if you could perhaps arrange a 45-minute delay to the start time, but still a full game, that would be much appreciated." You're all set Mark S, though I can't claim any credit for this... <b>UPDATE:</b> New start time is <b>11am local (4pm BST)</b> with no overs lost! <b>10.34am:</b> Mel Farrell's latest from the ground: "The sun is now shining and the ground staff are back out there along with the umps. This is very typical of the weather we've had here for the past few days." <b>10.28am:</b> Robert: "Historically this is one of the hardest grounds to chase on. I'd almost never bat first in T20 but here it makes sense. If we can post a decent I see this going close." Yep - since 2021 there have been 13 completed games here in all T20s: 8 bat-first wins, 4 chasing wins and one tie. As far as T20Is are concerned, there have been <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/ground/59429.html?class=3;template=results;type=aggregate;view=results">seven successful run-chases out of 24</a>. Then again, last year Barbados Royals <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/caribbean-premier-league-2023-1369538/barbados-royals-vs-st-kitts-and-nevis-patriots-18th-match-1369575/full-scorecard">munched a target of 221 here with 11 balls to spare</a> in the CPL. <b>10.25am:</b> That shout of this weather blowing through before the designated start time looks a tad optimistic right now. Anyway... It's not just Archer and Jordan back in familiar surroundings. Phil Salt spent a chunk of his upbringing in Barbados. He was in the stands when England won their first ICC trophy in 2010's World T20 and even got to <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/eng-vs-sco-t20-world-cup-2024-from-punter-to-protagonist-phil-salt-returns-to-kensington-oval-1436603">touch the trophy during the victory lap</a>... <b>10.18am</b> Annoyingly, a bit of light drizzle has drifted through the ground and the covers have come on. The broadcasters don't seem too bothered by it and reckon it'll blow through before we start in about 12 minutes. In fact, it's just got a heavier. Jamie C: "Why is everyone so concerned in T20s about used pitches? If it has had one match on it before (42 overs in this case), everyone doesn't complain about the second innings in an ODI or Day 2 of a Test Match so why the big fuss in this situation." I suppose it's not so much that it was a used pitch, just how the pitch played for Namibia and Oman. Could be a leveller, but who knows. Your guess is as good as mine! <b>10.16am</b> Arshad Naveed : "When did Scotland beat England last ?Do we hope so today?" Back in 2018, in a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/eng-in-scotland-2018-1127281/scotland-vs-england-only-odi-1124639/full-scorecard">one-off ODI up in Edinburgh</a>. Great game it was, too! A repeat today would be glorious <b>10.05am:</b> News from the middle is that <b> Scotland have won the toss and elected to bat first!</b> "It does look on the drier side, but as we have seen on this trip so far, the wickets can change ground to ground, day to day," says Scotland skipper Richie Berrington. "As a team, we want to progress as far as we can. Hopefully we can come out and make a few more special memories today." Jos Buttler says he'd have bowled first anyway. "Everyone's really excited to get going. It was a 50-50 call [with Topley and Wood] but we've gone for the extra pace of Wood today." <b>England</b>: 1 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 2 Phil Salt, 3 Will Jacks, 4 Jonny Bairstow, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Mark Wood, 11 Adil Rashid <b>Scotland</b>: 1 George Munsey, 2 Michael Jones, 3 Brandon McMullen, 4 Richie Berrington (capt), 5 Matt Cross (wk), 6 Michael Leask, 7 Chris Greaves, 8 Mark Watt, 9 Brad Wheal, 10 Chris Sole, 11 Brad Currie <b>9.54am:</b> ShahSafeer: "Being the only team who had won world cup here before, current champs and Jofra's return definitely make England the favourites to retain the trophy. I will surprised though if they go with Mark Wood ahead of Reece Topley, Eng have enough pace in Archer and Jordan, Topley adds variations which would make their attack even stronger." Ditto, also surprised that it looks like Wood over Topley, particularly given the latter offers something different, as you say. As for Jofra Archer, it's great to see him on the world stage again, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-eng-vs-scot-it-s-time-for-jofra-archer-s-homecoming-1436689">back where his journey into the game began...</a> <b>9.45am:</b> Despite not being able to call upon batter Andrew Umeed and seamer Josh Davey - who has appeared at the last three T20 World Cups, including a 2021 best of nine wickets at 13.6 - Scotland have an exciting squad that also boasts recent Caribbean experience. In left-armer Brad Currie, they have an attack leader who is not only in decent nick, having taken 2 for 26 in last week's warm-up match against Afghanistan, but is also one hell of a fielder. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/meet-brad-currie-the-scotland-seamer-who-took-the-greatest-catch-of-all-time-1436466">He's also a dab hand at FPL</a>, don't you know, ranking 6,000th out of 10 million players in the 2023/24 season <b>9.33am:</b> For those asking about the weather - and team news - this update from Mel Farrell out in Barbados has you covered: "Good morning from Kensington Oval! Looks like Wood has got the nod over Topley in the speed selection stakes. I can barely hold my phone as I type this because I'm a ball of sweat. Who needs a sauna in this humidity? Patchy sky and the clouds are moving quickly. If a storm hits, we might not get much warning." <b>9.27am</b> Charles: "A lot of people dismiss us, but Scotland have won a lot of games to be here today. No freebies, no handouts. We're here to compete at the highest level. I hope you're all watching!" <b>9.15am:</b> Mark: "Grudge match it may be but, anything less than a big England win and the vultures will be circling over the England camp." I think that's fair comment. And it's clear the England camp are that way inclined. Jos Buttler bristled when asked about lessons learned from the woeful ODI World Cup defence, particularly during a <a href="https://x.com/bbctms/status/1797647306759766280">broadcast spot with the BBC</a>. Understandable, perhaps, given the scale of criticism they had to wear for those weeks in India. Nevertheless, they seem focused for the challenges that await in the Caribbean, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-england-to-face-scotland-on-used-pitch-1436552">starting with this pitch</a>. <b>9.00am:</b> Howdy legends - what a grudge match we have in store for you today! England and Scotland kick off their respective World Cup campaigns against one another here in Bridgetown. Absurdly, it's the first meeting between the two in the T20I format.

<B>2.09pm</B> "The floodlights just went out for a brief moment!" says Mel... shouldn't matter at 2pm in the Caribbean. But we live in strange times. The players are ready. Let's do this. <B>2.06pm</B> Right, here come the players... Moeen Ali to rush through the remainder of his spell, and hand the ball to Rashid, you'd suspect... <B>2.02pm</B> Eight minutes until the restart, the tension is palpable! Incidentally, how many times have England beaten European opposition at T20 World Cups? <a href=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/team/1.html?class=3;filter=advanced;opposition=15;opposition=29;orderby=start;template=results;type=team;view=results>Yep, you got it in one...</A> Tom: "Will the DLS take into account that Scotland will presumably have much more of their batting innings under powerplay conditions? That's a big advantage to them." Yes, it will... though by how much? That's been the oft-repeated criticism of Duckworth-Lewis in T20s - it under-estimates just how hard batters can go these days - although the introduction of Mr Stern's (S's) calculations have redressed the balance somewhat. Danish: "Scotland wouldn't mind if match won't continue. " I dunno ... you only live once. And this is a huge moment in their professional lives. <B>1.57pm</B> "Meanwhile, Chris Sole and Mark Watt are sending some down as England warm up in the outfield. So expect some heat and canny left-arm surprise when England bat." Watt will be a key weapon. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2022-23-1298134/scotland-vs-west-indies-3rd-match-first-round-group-b-1298137/full-scorecard>Here's one he prepared earlier </A>in a T20 World Cup...

It will be a <B>2.10pm restart!</B> Right, here we go. <B>10 overs per side</B>, so 22 balls left for Scotland to bosh something hefty... and they will get a DLS bump too... this is going to get very tasty indeed! "The covers are all off and the umps were a little early with their inspection. Jones and Munsey just had a look and Scotland are warming up on the outfield. They're keen." I'll bet they are... Two overs per bowler, so <B>Wood and Archer cannot bowl!</B> Four more balls of Moeen, then Rashid for two and Jordan? Rashid at least has experience of bowling at the death <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-tour-of-wi-2018-19-1158056/west-indies-vs-england-4th-odi-1158069/full-scorecard>in a Caribbean bosh-fest...</A> <B>1.49pm</B> We are on tenterhooks for the inspection. Stay tuned! <B>1.27pm</B> Here's our Melinda with the latest from the front line: "The umps are out in the middle and the groundstaff are getting the supersopper ready. And it's off around the outfield! The clouds are breaking up a bit. All positive signs, huzzah!" Scenes! Let the race against time begin! The next inspection will be at <B>1.50pm</B>. Assuming that is positive, we might get a start 30 minutes later, which is just 30 minutes before the cut-off. Saqib: "No one is talking about DLS Par Score? Any calculations?" Nothing to calculate against. But if Scotland's innings is over, then England could face a chase of 66 in five overs, as mentioned earlier. On that... there is still a strong possibility that this game could get zapped by the cut-off time (2.52pm, remember), only for Australia to arrive for training under lovely blue skies later this afternoon. Pranali: "If i was JButler and this match is shoetened to less than 10 overs a side, I would open with Phil and Will because you might see spin early on but mostly because it rhymes." <B>1.17pm</B> The cut-off time for the start of a five-over run-chase is <B>2.52pm local</B>. That's a bit over 90 minutes from now. So there's still plenty of time to get a game in. Proper frolics if England blow this! "You suspect if it comes down to a 5 over smashathon, Salt might bosh them home," notes our Mel. "But any miscues or a misbehaving pitch then it's on." Dave the Hammer: "I'm sitting in the Greenidge and Haynes stand 6 beers deep and I've played in worse than this. Get them out there " On Hackney Marshes, no doubt, if I've interpreted the Hammer aspect correctly...! Mehdi: "Can someone explain why we are losing overs since it is only 1.15pm?! Surely can just restart the game under lights? " It does seem curious. The IPL wouldn't stand for this nonsense! <B>1.12pm</B> The local weather reports seem much better for the foreseeable, but how much of a game might we be able to sneak in? Mel doesn't feel the optimism just yet though. "The latest news is that there is no news and no change. The dj is doing his best to keep the party vibes going but it's all feeling a bit damp squibby." Manish Thaduri: "By what mysterious cosmic decree do Melinda's erudite pronouncements perpetually achieve publication, while our own gems of wisdom languish in obscurity?" Melinda is literally Cricinfo's eyes on the ground for this match. When they aren't on her plate, of course. Mashfi: "England going to the danger zone? Isn't it Scotland who'll be in the back foot if the game resumes?" But with nothing to lose? They'd be delighted to set England 13 an over to win! Andrew: "I think Namibia will be watching this game very closely with all the rain around, could cause something interesting for the whole group" Ain't that the truth. Even a wash-out would make Saturday's game against Australia <I>very</i> tasty... as if it wasn't already! <B>12.58pm</B> "I believe the rain has ceased and I can see the horizon again," says Mel. "The wind has died down considerably." Now then. England really are veering into the danger zone now... jens: "is snarfs even a word?" It's onomatopoeic ... the sound of Melinda face down in the trough... Darpan : "Andrew, you are funny when you use the words I can understand." Why thank you, I think! Mel always says so... <B>12.47pm</B> So, what gives on the front line? "It's eased a bit but still raining," says Melinda, between snarfs of jerk chicken. "And it's dark whichever direction you look. But lunch is delicious." First with the big news... Talking of which, if Scotland don't manage to get back on here, England could be facing a chase of <B>77 in six overs, or 66 in five</B>... That would warrant an eyes emoji if our ancient old CMS could handle such new-fangled communications... <B>12.29pm</B> It is tipping it down, this is deeply suboptimal. Five minutes until we start to lose overs, so that is a given. Might not be much more than a five-over chase to aim for if this persists much longer. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-twenty20-2010-412671/west-indies-vs-england-8th-match-group-d-412685/full-scorecard>England have been there before </A>in Caribbean World Cup campaigns... Jake L: "Rain here is to Scotland's advantage. DL doesn't know that they are the inferior side or that it's a tricky batting surface . If we lose overs, DL will look at 51/0 off 6.2 and think Scotland were due a massive score. England will be set a tough chase accordingly." "Absolutely chucking it down and I can't see much beyond the ground," adds Lindy F, from her press-box vantage point. Urk. <B>12.16pm</B> Covers back on. Meh. That looks rather dank over on the horizon. We won't be starting at 12.20... There's about 20 minutes left before we start to lose overs... which will not be to Scotland's advantage, I wouldn't have thought. "Lightning," declares Melinda. That's not going to help proceedings. Sriram: "I think I will stick with the other rodeo for now." <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/netherlands-vs-nepal-7th-match-group-d-1415707/live-cricket-score>Fair.</A> <B>12.09pm</B> Right, better news in Bridgetown.

Bah. It's just a bit moist. The covers are coming on, as the umpires whip out the stumps. "They are really struggling to manage the covers in this wind," notes Melinda Farrell. On the plus side, the wind will hopefully push this filth along quickly Amal: "A lot of solar panels are going to be destroyed here. It was just a 87 metre six and the panels sit midwicket. A lot of powerful pulls are going to come that way." They won't be drawing much energy in this weather either. Hanzala: "So, as soon as I start watching again its starts raining again. For God's sake just let me watch a match in peace man. Last time I watched this match, it hadn't even started yet cuz of rain and now this!"

over the wicket to the left-hander, pitches outside leg and grips, it's the googly, and is there a tickle as Munsey swings into a slog-sweep? <strong>England are reviewing</strong> The ball lobbed off the knee-roll, up through the arms, and into Buttler's gloves. But doesn't look like bat, or glove. Still, another dot. Pitched way outside leg for the academic lbw appeal

Right, we are just about ready. Players heading to the middle. Ashton Agar will get the first over. So Australia trying some things. Everyone is ready a little early! Here we go... <b>8.20pm</b> Hello again, folks. Can Scotland's top order give them something to defend? George Bailey, Australia's national selector, has spoken to reporters in the Caribbean about the reasoning behind giving Ashton Agar an outing: "Deep in a tournament, when the same grounds are being used a lot, we're starting to see some wickets that are starting to show a bit of fatigue in the West Indies," he said. "A lot of the guys we've got in the group have got a bunch of cricket behind them, either through the IPL most recently or have played quite a bit in this team. "But Ash, just coming off his injuries and the way we've structured up when he has been available, he just hasn't been able to get much game time, as much as he'd probably like. He's training really well, as is everyone, but just getting that opportunity in the middle to be able to put that into place, for Mitch to be able to navigate what it's like with a number of spinners in the team." <b>8.15pm</b> So, Scotland have a chance to put runs on the board. But how many will be enough? Do keep in mind that no run rate equation is going to save them. Andrew is back for the first ten overs. "A nice grass covering," adds Matthew Hayden. "Not going to turn a great deal. But it will have a little bit of extra bounce and extra pace. Winning the toss is a big advantage." "The weather in absolutely fantastic," Pommie Mbangwa says in his pitch report. "There is a pretty strong wind blowing across. The two square boundaries are 66 and 69 metres. Down the ground is 78 metres." <b>8.10pm</b> Here are the XIs <b>Australia</b>: 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Nathan Ellis, 11 Adam Zampa <b>Scotland</b>: 1 George Munsey, 2 Michael Jones, 3 Brandon McMullen, 4 Richie Berrington (capt), 5 Matthew Cross (wk), 6 Michael Leask, 7 Chris Greaves, 8 Mark Watt, 9 Chris Sole, 10 Brad Wheal, 11 Safyaan Sharif <b>8pm Australia have won the toss and opted to bowl</b>. "Looks a really good surface," says Mitchell Marsh. "It's like another World Cup game and we have a lot of respect for Scotland. Two changes: Cummins and Hazlewood are out (rested), Starc and Agar come in." "For us, the chatter is out of our control," says Richie Berrington. "We knew we had to beat some of the best teams to qualify. We have gone with the same team as last game." Aaron: "To be honest, I don't get what the fuss is all about. Australia will win in easy manner and help England get in to the Super 8. But England have really deep flaws in their batting and bowling department. West Indies and SA are very likely to knock them out in my eyes." Shazil: "As a Pakistani , england deserve to stay in this tournament. Unlike Pakistan and New Zealand who werent good enough and lost 2 matches, England only lost one game and would be incredibly unlucky to be knocked out here. That being said if Scotland can manage to beat Australia then they would deserve it too." Arfaa: "Australia won't look to lose this game, but will definitely rest (especially with 3 games in 4 days coming up soon). Most likely to rest Starc, Hazelwood, and Stoinis who've all had fitness issues lately, and play Ellis, Agar and Green. Might give Inglis the gloves over Wade too. " Matt Roller is at the venue and says Starc and Hazlewood are going through a fitness session on the outfield while the rest of the squad prepares. Does that mean both are going to be rested? <b>7.35pm</b> Thanks, Andrew, and hello everyone. <b>7.30pm</b> One thing to watch for this evening will be <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-aus-vs-sco-mark-watt-set-to-continue-with-24-yard-delivery-against-australia-1438736">Mark Watt and his long ball</a>.

On that note, I'm going to hand over to Hemant for the rest of the build-up. <b>7.25pm</b> Right, welcome back, folks. And here's Jack: "Great to welcome the English fans into our camp for this game. Come and feel how a victory, not morally, is all about!" Play nice, everyone!

"The weather in absolutely fantastic," Pommie Mbangwa says in his pitch report. "There is a pretty strong wind blowing across. The two square boundaries are 66 and 69 metres. Down the ground is 78 metres." <b>8.10pm</b> Here are the XIs <b>Australia</b>: 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Nathan Ellis, 11 Adam Zampa <b>Scotland</b>: 1 George Munsey, 2 Michael Jones, 3 Brandon McMullen, 4 Richie Berrington (capt), 5 Matthew Cross (wk), 6 Michael Leask, 7 Chris Greaves, 8 Mark Watt, 9 Chris Sole, 10 Brad Wheal, 11 Safyaan Sharif <b>8pm Australia have won the toss and opted to bowl</b>. "Looks a really good surface," says Mitchell Marsh. "It's like another World Cup game and we have a lot of respect for Scotland. Two changes: Cummins and Hazlewood are out (rested), Starc and Agar come in." "For us, the chatter is out of our control," says Richie Berrington. "We knew we had to beat some of the best teams to qualify. We have gone with the same team as last game." Aaron: "To be honest, I don't get what the fuss is all about. Australia will win in easy manner and help England get in to the Super 8. But England have really deep flaws in their batting and bowling department. West Indies and SA are very likely to knock them out in my eyes." Shazil: "As a Pakistani , england deserve to stay in this tournament. Unlike Pakistan and New Zealand who werent good enough and lost 2 matches, England only lost one game and would be incredibly unlucky to be knocked out here. That being said if Scotland can manage to beat Australia then they would deserve it too." Arfaa: "Australia won't look to lose this game, but will definitely rest (especially with 3 games in 4 days coming up soon). Most likely to rest Starc, Hazelwood, and Stoinis who've all had fitness issues lately, and play Ellis, Agar and Green. Might give Inglis the gloves over Wade too. " Matt Roller is at the venue and says Starc and Hazlewood are going through a fitness session on the outfield while the rest of the squad prepares. Does that mean both are going to be rested? <b>7.35pm</b> Thanks, Andrew, and hello everyone. <b>7.30pm</b> One thing to watch for this evening will be <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-aus-vs-sco-mark-watt-set-to-continue-with-24-yard-delivery-against-australia-1438736">Mark Watt and his long ball</a>.

Only issue is they are playing Australia. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-scotland-35th-match-group-b-1415735/match-preview">Can they conjure their most famous day?</a> I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Hemant Brar will bring you all the action. The weather looks good in St Lucia (a washout would also do for Scotland) so doesn't appear that will be a factor. Will England be cheering on Australia from their hotel? We'll be back with our full build-up shortly. James: "I won't be the only Englishman experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime event tonight: I'm going to find out what it's like supporting Australia in a world cup. Come on Davey Warner! Come on Hazlewood! Never thought I'd say it but here goes: Aussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi!! "
