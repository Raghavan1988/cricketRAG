The weather looks good in St Lucia (a washout would also do for Scotland) so doesn't appear that will be a factor. Will England be cheering on Australia from their hotel?

Come on Davey Warner! Come on Hazlewood! Never thought I'd say it but here goes: Aussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi!! \""}]Right, we are just about ready. Players heading to the middle. Ashton Agar will get the first over. So Australia trying some things. Everyone is ready a little early! Here we go... <b>8.20pm</b> Hello again, folks. Can Scotland's top order give them something to defend? George Bailey, Australia's national selector, has spoken to reporters in the Caribbean about the reasoning behind giving Ashton Agar an outing: "Deep in a tournament, when the same grounds are being used a lot, we're starting to see some wickets that are starting to show a bit of fatigue in the West Indies," he said. "A lot of the guys we've got in the group have got a bunch of cricket behind them, either through the IPL most recently or have played quite a bit in this team. "But Ash, just coming off his injuries and the way we've structured up when he has been available, he just hasn't been able to get much game time, as much as he'd probably like. He's training really well, as is everyone, but just getting that opportunity in the middle to be able to put that into place, for Mitch to be able to navigate what it's like with a number of spinners in the team." <b>8.15pm</b> So, Scotland have a chance to put runs on the board. But how many will be enough? Do keep in mind that no run rate equation is going to save them. Andrew is back for the first ten overs. "A nice grass covering," adds Matthew Hayden. "Not going to turn a great deal. But it will have a little bit of extra bounce and extra pace. Winning the toss is a big advantage." "The weather in absolutely fantastic," Pommie Mbangwa says in his pitch report. "There is a pretty strong wind blowing across. The two square boundaries are 66 and 69 metres. Down the ground is 78 metres." <b>8.10pm</b> Here are the XIs <b>Australia</b>: 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Nathan Ellis, 11 Adam Zampa <b>Scotland</b>: 1 George Munsey, 2 Michael Jones, 3 Brandon McMullen, 4 Richie Berrington (capt), 5 Matthew Cross (wk), 6 Michael Leask, 7 Chris Greaves, 8 Mark Watt, 9 Chris Sole, 10 Brad Wheal, 11 Safyaan Sharif <b>8pm Australia have won the toss and opted to bowl</b>. "Looks a really good surface," says Mitchell Marsh. "It's like another World Cup game and we have a lot of respect for Scotland. Two changes: Cummins and Hazlewood are out (rested), Starc and Agar come in." "For us, the chatter is out of our control," says Richie Berrington. "We knew we had to beat some of the best teams to qualify. We have gone with the same team as last game." Aaron: "To be honest, I don't get what the fuss is all about. Australia will win in easy manner and help England get in to the Super 8. But England have really deep flaws in their batting and bowling department. West Indies and SA are very likely to knock them out in my eyes." Shazil: "As a Pakistani , england deserve to stay in this tournament. Unlike Pakistan and New Zealand who werent good enough and lost 2 matches, England only lost one game and would be incredibly unlucky to be knocked out here. That being said if Scotland can manage to beat Australia then they would deserve it too." Arfaa: "Australia won't look to lose this game, but will definitely rest (especially with 3 games in 4 days coming up soon). Most likely to rest Starc, Hazelwood, and Stoinis who've all had fitness issues lately, and play Ellis, Agar and Green. Might give Inglis the gloves over Wade too. " Matt Roller is at the venue and says Starc and Hazlewood are going through a fitness session on the outfield while the rest of the squad prepares. Does that mean both are going to be rested? <b>7.35pm</b> Thanks, Andrew, and hello everyone. <b>7.30pm</b> One thing to watch for this evening will be <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-aus-vs-sco-mark-watt-set-to-continue-with-24-yard-delivery-against-australia-1438736">Mark Watt and his long ball</a>.

On that note, I'm going to hand over to Hemant for the rest of the build-up. <b>7.25pm</b> Right, welcome back, folks. And here's Jack: "Great to welcome the English fans into our camp for this game. Come and feel how a victory, not morally, is all about!" Play nice, everyone!

We await to see what changes Australia could make this evening.

Only issue is they are playing Australia. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-scotland-35th-match-group-b-1415735/match-preview">Can they conjure their most famous day?</a> I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Hemant Brar will bring you all the action. The weather looks good in St Lucia (a washout would also do for Scotland) so doesn't appear that will be a factor. Will England be cheering on Australia from their hotel? We'll be back with our full build-up shortly. James: "I won't be the only Englishman experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime event tonight: I'm going to find out what it's like supporting Australia in a world cup. Come on Davey Warner! Come on Hazlewood! Never thought I'd say it but here goes: Aussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi!! "

The weather looks good in St Lucia (a washout would also do for Scotland) so doesn't appear that will be a factor. Will England be cheering on Australia from their hotel?

Come on Davey Warner! Come on Hazlewood! Never thought I'd say it but here goes: Aussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi!! \""}]Right, we are just about ready. Players heading to the middle. Ashton Agar will get the first over. So Australia trying some things. Everyone is ready a little early! Here we go... <b>8.20pm</b> Hello again, folks. Can Scotland's top order give them something to defend? George Bailey, Australia's national selector, has spoken to reporters in the Caribbean about the reasoning behind giving Ashton Agar an outing: "Deep in a tournament, when the same grounds are being used a lot, we're starting to see some wickets that are starting to show a bit of fatigue in the West Indies," he said. "A lot of the guys we've got in the group have got a bunch of cricket behind them, either through the IPL most recently or have played quite a bit in this team. "But Ash, just coming off his injuries and the way we've structured up when he has been available, he just hasn't been able to get much game time, as much as he'd probably like. He's training really well, as is everyone, but just getting that opportunity in the middle to be able to put that into place, for Mitch to be able to navigate what it's like with a number of spinners in the team." <b>8.15pm</b> So, Scotland have a chance to put runs on the board. But how many will be enough? Do keep in mind that no run rate equation is going to save them. Andrew is back for the first ten overs. "A nice grass covering," adds Matthew Hayden. "Not going to turn a great deal. But it will have a little bit of extra bounce and extra pace. Winning the toss is a big advantage." "The weather in absolutely fantastic," Pommie Mbangwa says in his pitch report. "There is a pretty strong wind blowing across. The two square boundaries are 66 and 69 metres. Down the ground is 78 metres." <b>8.10pm</b> Here are the XIs <b>Australia</b>: 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Tim David, 7 Matthew Wade (wk), 8 Ashton Agar, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Nathan Ellis, 11 Adam Zampa <b>Scotland</b>: 1 George Munsey, 2 Michael Jones, 3 Brandon McMullen, 4 Richie Berrington (capt), 5 Matthew Cross (wk), 6 Michael Leask, 7 Chris Greaves, 8 Mark Watt, 9 Chris Sole, 10 Brad Wheal, 11 Safyaan Sharif <b>8pm Australia have won the toss and opted to bowl</b>. "Looks a really good surface," says Mitchell Marsh. "It's like another World Cup game and we have a lot of respect for Scotland. Two changes: Cummins and Hazlewood are out (rested), Starc and Agar come in." "For us, the chatter is out of our control," says Richie Berrington. "We knew we had to beat some of the best teams to qualify. We have gone with the same team as last game." Aaron: "To be honest, I don't get what the fuss is all about. Australia will win in easy manner and help England get in to the Super 8. But England have really deep flaws in their batting and bowling department. West Indies and SA are very likely to knock them out in my eyes." Shazil: "As a Pakistani , england deserve to stay in this tournament. Unlike Pakistan and New Zealand who werent good enough and lost 2 matches, England only lost one game and would be incredibly unlucky to be knocked out here. That being said if Scotland can manage to beat Australia then they would deserve it too." Arfaa: "Australia won't look to lose this game, but will definitely rest (especially with 3 games in 4 days coming up soon). Most likely to rest Starc, Hazelwood, and Stoinis who've all had fitness issues lately, and play Ellis, Agar and Green. Might give Inglis the gloves over Wade too. " Matt Roller is at the venue and says Starc and Hazlewood are going through a fitness session on the outfield while the rest of the squad prepares. Does that mean both are going to be rested? <b>7.35pm</b> Thanks, Andrew, and hello everyone. <b>7.30pm</b> One thing to watch for this evening will be <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-aus-vs-sco-mark-watt-set-to-continue-with-24-yard-delivery-against-australia-1438736">Mark Watt and his long ball</a>.

On that note, I'm going to hand over to Hemant for the rest of the build-up. <b>7.25pm</b> Right, welcome back, folks. And here's Jack: "Great to welcome the English fans into our camp for this game. Come and feel how a victory, not morally, is all about!" Play nice, everyone!

We await to see what changes Australia could make this evening.

Only issue is they are playing Australia. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-scotland-35th-match-group-b-1415735/match-preview">Can they conjure their most famous day?</a> I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Hemant Brar will bring you all the action. The weather looks good in St Lucia (a washout would also do for Scotland) so doesn't appear that will be a factor. Will England be cheering on Australia from their hotel? We'll be back with our full build-up shortly. James: "I won't be the only Englishman experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime event tonight: I'm going to find out what it's like supporting Australia in a world cup. Come on Davey Warner! Come on Hazlewood! Never thought I'd say it but here goes: Aussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi!! "
