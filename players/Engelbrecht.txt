<strong>Mix-up, should have been a run out but the Fizz misses the direct hit at the non-striker's end</strong>. Fielder from midwicket was running to the left, the bowler - to the left of the pitch, three-fourth of the way down - looked for a moment to see if he can throw to someone but decided he didn't have the time. Tried getting it on the bounce but missed. The ball was defended with an angled bat and Vikramjit was three-fourth of the way down and Engelbrecht was hesitant.
