Phehlukwayo gathers cleanly but is unaware that Rahmat is stranded half-way. Takes an eternity to release the ball and then misses the stumps too. Massive opportunity goes abegging

<B>6pm</b> South Africa will be disappointed that Afghanistan batted all 50 overs. Target wise, South Africa will be happy chasing 245 even if they don't love chasing in particular. Omarzai's 97 held the Afghan innings together and ensured they very nearly got to 250. Otherwise, Afghanistan had an ordinary batting performance after the openers fell in succession. Noor's 26 was also very valuable. de Kock also enters the record books as does Coetzee (for now) as South Africa's highest wicket-taker (18) at a single WC edition. Saurabh: "Does this mean that Afghanistan are officially out?" --  out of semi contention, yes. But still they'd want to be fifth (above Pakistan) and now sixth (below) so lots to play for. Being the second-best Asian team is a matter of pride too for them
