When Nabi and Azmat were playing we had hope, and when there were 15 overs left we thought it could happen. But Sri Lanka played well." Nissanka: "I tried to fix my mistakes (of getting fifties and not converting to 100s), so that's what I did. It was a good pitch to bat on. The start Avishka and I got was the foundation for the score we eventually got." Player of the match, no surprise is <b>Pathum Nissanka</b> for his 210*. Afghanistan will be pleased that they got to a serious total even in spite of such odds. Sri Lanka will worry about the health of Chameera, who leads their seam attack. <b>10.50pm</b> Phew, what a contest! Pathum Nissanka's magnificent double-century seems like a long time ago. Almost as long ago as when Afghanistan were down in the dumps at 55 for 5. But Azmatullah Omarzai and Mohammad Nabi fought valiantly, adding the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-partnership-for-the-sixth-wicket-283572">second-highest partnership for the sixth wicket in ODIs</a>. Both of them scored centuries, recording their individual career-best scores in the format. They fought through cramps and helmet-hits. But in the end, Pramod Madushan's brilliant opening spell with a fine follow-up act from Dushmantha Chameera, proved to be enough to ensure Nissanka's magnum opus didn't go in vain. These two teams have thrown up a thriller, as they often tend to do! What a great game of cricket. And now, Fidel will take you through the presentation ceremony. Joe: "A win for SL , but great fightback by Afghanistan "
