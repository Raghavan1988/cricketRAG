<strong>oh dear! How have South Africa botched this!?</strong> Length outside off and this seems to just stick in the surface.

Phehlukwayo gathers cleanly but is unaware that Rahmat is stranded half-way. Takes an eternity to release the ball and then misses the stumps too. Massive opportunity goes abegging

<B>6pm</b> South Africa will be disappointed that Afghanistan batted all 50 overs. Target wise, South Africa will be happy chasing 245 even if they don't love chasing in particular. Omarzai's 97 held the Afghan innings together and ensured they very nearly got to 250. Otherwise, Afghanistan had an ordinary batting performance after the openers fell in succession. Noor's 26 was also very valuable. de Kock also enters the record books as does Coetzee (for now) as South Africa's highest wicket-taker (18) at a single WC edition. Saurabh: "Does this mean that Afghanistan are officially out?" --  out of semi contention, yes. But still they'd want to be fifth (above Pakistan) and now sixth (below) so lots to play for. Being the second-best Asian team is a matter of pride too for them

<strong>Henry gets rid of Omarzai!</strong> Seems like a slower ball, bowled at around 127kph. Pitches on a full length on middle and off, tempting Omarzai to go inside out. The bat face, though, opens upon contact and he cannot generate the power he is after. Slices it towards deep cover point, where Ferguson holds on. A useful cameo, though, and it has given Afghanistan the continuity they needed after that opening stand!

Full around off, swings it out to long-on. Afganistan get to their highest ODI total. Omarzai finishes unbeaten on 149, but <strong>Sri Lanka end up the winners, by 42 runs!</strong>
That's it from us folks. We'll see you again on Sunday for ODI numero dos. Catch you then. Fidel Fernando, Abhimanyu Bose, and Chandan Duorah signing off. Take it easy! Kusal Mendis: "Pramod bowled well along with Dushy. When the middle overs came the wicket was very good to bat on. That's the main reason for them getting runs then I think. I was thinking it would be a 300-320 wicket. We weren't thinking the pitch would be this good. I'm glad we got in  380 in the end, given they got close." Hashmatullah: "We decided to bat first because of the dew factor - we thought there would be some towards the end of the innings. In the powerplay overs we were not up to the mark and we gave away a lot of runs. They took that momentum and carried on. When Nabi and Azmat were playing we had hope, and when there were 15 overs left we thought it could happen. But Sri Lanka played well." Nissanka: "I tried to fix my mistakes (of getting fifties and not converting to 100s), so that's what I did. It was a good pitch to bat on. The start Avishka and I got was the foundation for the score we eventually got." Player of the match, no surprise is <b>Pathum Nissanka</b> for his 210*. Afghanistan will be pleased that they got to a serious total even in spite of such odds. Sri Lanka will worry about the health of Chameera, who leads their seam attack. <b>10.50pm</b> Phew, what a contest! Pathum Nissanka's magnificent double-century seems like a long time ago. Almost as long ago as when Afghanistan were down in the dumps at 55 for 5. But Azmatullah Omarzai and Mohammad Nabi fought valiantly, adding the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-partnership-for-the-sixth-wicket-283572">second-highest partnership for the sixth wicket in ODIs</a>. Both of them scored centuries, recording their individual career-best scores in the format. They fought through cramps and helmet-hits. But in the end, Pramod Madushan's brilliant opening spell with a fine follow-up act from Dushmantha Chameera, proved to be enough to ensure Nissanka's magnum opus didn't go in vain. These two teams have thrown up a thriller, as they often tend to do! What a great game of cricket. And now, Fidel will take you through the presentation ceremony. Joe: "A win for SL , but great fightback by Afghanistan "

Chops the 94ks length ball outside off through backward point. Kuldeep runs to the left and tumbles over 360 degrees as he pulls the ball back in. The towel was tucked on the back of his trouser and it was flying close to the cushion. Third ump says he's good

Length on leg, Azmat stays legside of the ball and clips it to midwicket. Two bounces on the square before going to the keeper. Ump tells SKY, the fielder, not to do it. Simon Doull, on air, not a fan of that. Says reverse swing is a great skill and teams should try and get it as long as sandpaper isn't involved

dolly at long-on, Afghanistan are unravelling very quickly. Jadeja gets this to turn off a length, it's an ugly hack against the turn from Omarzai but only managed to toe-end it.
