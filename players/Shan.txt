The ball drops on him and then continues with the arm. Shanto played for the turn too and left a gap between bat and pad. The ball burst through to strike timber, and Bangladesh are now two down!

Really happy with the way we bowled. I'm not giving any bowler's particular credit, they all bowled really well. Shoriful bowled well during the BPL as well, so he's found his form and I'm happy for him. [batters?] I think Litton and Soumya started very well, and later on Hridoy batted really well.

Hopefully I'll continue my form." <B>Charith Asalanka</b>: "Firstly we were short about 20-25 runs, and then Kamindu's run out also played a huge part in the game. As a batsman we have to make big runs, especially in these conditions. Because it's very hard for the bowlers to bowl in these conditions. [Angelo Mathews chipped in?] Yes that's why he's in the side, he's a veteran now and he delivers for the team. [Bangladesh?] Credit goes to their batsman, especially Shanto, and Hridoy and Litton.

Shanto and Hridoy saw the chase through with 11 balls and 8 wickets to spare, and while Sri Lanka might have a legitimate grievance about Soumya's nick behind being unexpectedly overturned, Bangladesh were good value for their win. While Shanto got a fifty and each of Bangladesh's top four contributed well, it was their bowlers that did the damage, restricting Sri Lanka with some accurate and effective bowling - particularly at the death.

Their seamers took three apiece, while Sri Lanka's batters will be disappointed at having failed to build on some promising starts.
