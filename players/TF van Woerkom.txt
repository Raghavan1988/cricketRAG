Theo van Woerkom b Zia-ur-Rehman 1 (9b 0x4 0x6 8m) SR: 11.11
And Zia bursts the bubble, hits top of off to send the nightwatcher back with fewer than ten minutes to stumps! Length ball drifted in and pitched around leg, van Woerkom tried to cover the line and play it straight, but the ball ripped away past the edge and smashed the stumps. Big celebrations as the close-in fielders swoop in. Ireland ahead but Zia's helping the hosts claw back.
