<strong>9:58am</strong> There are a few clouds up and about but it's bright for now. The players make their way out. Tector will take strike. Naveed Zadran, who was impressive with the new ball, will start. He got two and bowled Moor off a no-ball. His pace and potential seam movement can make it hard. Two slips and gully are in. Ring field on the offside. Mid-on, midwicket and long leg on the legside. <strong>Barry McCarthy:</strong> It's taken a while to get here but it's got a lovely ring to it. It was nice to get off the mark yesterday. We knew that we would get assistance if we lost the toss and bowled first. We took good care of the ball. It was a surprise that the ball did so much in the afternoon. We'll have to see how it goes today, they found spin but not as much swing. <strong>Pitch report</strong>: Andrew Leonard says there were signs last night of spin. Tino Mawoyo says there'll be a lot more spin. It's dry, very little grass cover. Zia's lengths were tough for batters to get to. With more turn as the match goes on, batters will have to advance down to get to the pitch and smother spin, something Ireland didn't do yesterday. Hawk-Eye showed the wickets of Curtis Campher and Theo von Woerkom and the degree of spin were 6.3 and 5.9, huge for day 1. <strong>Day 1 report</strong>: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/afghanistan-vs-ireland-2023-24-1416063/afghanistan-vs-ireland-only-test-1416080/match-report">Adair rips through Afghanistan to give Ireland opening-day honours</a> <strong>9:35am, Day 2, Session 1</strong> How do you like your drama? If it's with a slow build up marked by consistent tension before a blow-up, today's cricket could suit your preferences. Afghanistan were rolled for 155 yesterday. Ireland managed to scurry away to a good start despite their openers looking rickety. However, Naveed Zadran's lateral movement and Zia-ur-Rehman's spin off the middle of the pitch meant Ireland's top order was gone and the ploy to send debutant Theo van Woerkom, as a nightwatcher, didn't work. Just 55 runs left for parity, Tector's looked like a million dollars, but Afghanistan know that if wickets tumble early like yesterday, this could become a single-innings shootout. Ireland, on the other hand, know they can bat the hosts out of the game.

<strong>Big appeal for lbw, looked tight and the ump waits a bit before giving it out</strong>. Landed on a length on fourth stump and decked back. It was essentially an offspinner at 130-plus kph.

<strong>dropped by Farooqi!</strong> He was at short fine leg, and was still in motion while moving to his left, as the ball hit his hands and trickled down. Rashid bowled it full and flat on middle and off, with a hint of turn away, as Delany went sweeping but got a top edge. Replays show Rashid had bowled that from really behind the crease

<strong>Rashid Khan</strong>: "Quite happy to be back on the field, and to be doing what I have been doing for the last eight-nine years. So happy to be contributing. Kharote was amazing in the last ODI; he's a full package, especially with the fielding he has. Here 150-160 is always a good total, but it depends on the wicket." <strong>9.38pm</strong> The innings ends with 6, 4, 4, 4 as the last five overs fetch 58 for Ireland. They were barely batting at better than a run a ball after 15 overs, before Tector ensured they had more than a competitive total on a slow pitch where the ball is turning. Rashid, coming back after four months out, took 3 for 19, but was done before Tector launched an assault to finish on 56* off 34 balls. There is dew aplenty already, so join us in ten for what should be a challenging defence for Ireland.
