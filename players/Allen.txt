Yeah, always ready to bowl, you can suggest that to captain (chuckles) Babar Azam had a good outing in the first T20I and thumped a half-century Samina: "The only problem that I could see in Babar's batting in T20 is that he makes his plan a day before the match and does not modify it according to match situation. When team needs a strike rate of 100 from ball 1. Your 100 SR might cement your place but not helping the team. Same goes for Imam ul haq in all formats." Shahzeb : "Rizbar is the best opening combination for Pakistan in t20Is. On any day, against any opposition, chasing any target, you will depend on these two only, not on some sloggers. They need to persist with the same combination who has given them so much success in past few years." AB: "What happened to Imad Wasim, why isn't he playing? I was thinking Rizwan, Saim, Babar, Fakhar, Iftikhar, Pace Allrounder, Imad/Shadab, Abrar, Shaheen, Naseem, Haris for the WC" Shhazil: "Waiting to see if Haris Rauf can create any impact in this match???.. or should he replaced with more deserving likes of wassem and zaman" <strong>New Zealand XI:</strong> Finn Allen, Devon Conway (wk), Kane Williamson (c), Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Ben Sears <strong>Shaheen Afridi:</strong> Abbas debut was a positive sign, hope he continues in that manner. We have to improve more in fielding, this wicket looks fine, ground measurement is decent and this match will be good, going with unchanged team <strong>Kane Williamson:</strong> I thought first half was good, bowlers executed their plans well. We start again and go back to what's in front of us, different venue and different conditions. <strong>Mitchell Santner comes in for Matt Henry</strong> Heads is the call and Shaheen Afridi wins the toss.<strong> Pakistan will bowl first. </strong> Sajjad: "Am I the only one who thinks Haris is operating on goodwill alone right now. I know "pace, pace hai yaar" but he needs to evolve with slower deliveries and offcutters. Otherwise Naseem will take over his slot instead of the one currently occupied by Abbas Afridi." Variations are very important in T20 cricket and indeed pace is not enough to thrive in this format Haseeb: "Saim Ayub, Riwan, Babar/Fakhar, and M. Haris will be the top 4 choices for World Cup." It's humid and there is a bit of cloud cover. It's a harder and faster track; the ground staff said it's one of the hardest surfaces they have prepared. It will offer good bounce and 190 seems to be a par score here <strong>6.27pm:</strong> Toss and New Zealand XI are coming up shortly. Hang around Deeps: "Pak team is not utilizing the talent of Fakhar properly, he should open the innings with Saim, Rizwan is much better in middle order. " Farzam : "Pakistan have a strong batting line-up and depth. However, the major decision for the World Cup will be the lower middle-order and bowlers. Inevitably, when Naseem is healthy we will play Naseem, Shaheen, Haris Rauf as our 3 pace bowlers with Saim, Rizwan, Babar and Fakhar as the top 4. That leaves 4 spots: for ifthikar, and the other 3 are up for grabs. Those final 3 spots in the playing 11 will be key. Will need a lower-order hitter than two all-rounders (likely one of or both as spinners?)" Sajjad : "Zaman Khan is the future star of Pakistan team he should be included in the team" <strong>Tim Southee</strong> became the first player to pick up 150 wickets in T20I cricket. He got to the milestone in his 118th match. New Zealand have been hit by an injury as Josh Clarkson has been pulled out of the squad owing to a shoulder injury <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/will-young-to-replace-josh-clarkson-in-nz-squad-for-third-t20i-vs-pakistan-1416515">Young to replace injured Clarkson in New Zealand's squad for third T20I</a> Pakistan are going with an unchanged line up <strong>Pakistan XI:</strong> M Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Azam Khan (wk), Aamir Jamal, Usama Mir, Shaheen Afridi (c), Abbas Afridi, Haris Rauf <strong>6.10pm:</strong> Hello cricket enthusiasts and welcome to the second the second T20I of the five-match series between New Zealand and Pakistan in Hamilton. Rvel Zahid here to take you through all the action tonight New Zealand played in an ultra-aggressive mood with the bat, decimating Pakistan's bowling attack in the series opener. Anything loose was duly sent to the boundary rope as New Zealand posted a mammoth 227 the other day, which proved to be out of reach for Pakistan. Pakistan deviated from their most successful opening pair of Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, with Saim Ayub opening the batting and former Pakistan captain Babar Azam batting at No.3. Saim Ayub batted beautifully and played some eye-catching strokes, including his incredible trademark no-look flick over fine leg. Unfortunately, he was run out in the third over. It looked like he was given a license to go all guns blazing in the powerplay, and he made good use of the fielding restrictions. Ayub has been brilliant in franchise tournaments over the last year and will be aiming to carry on his good form; he has been given a second chance to cement his spot in the national team. Abbas Afridi had a great debut, he took three vital wickets, as his back-of-the-hand slower deliveries were hard to pick. He showed hardly any signs of nerves in his first international appearance for Pakistan. Meanwhile, Aamer Jamal leaked plenty of runs and was a little wayward, and Usama Mir had a poor outing as well. Pakistan are trying to find the right combination before the T20 World Cup and are experimenting with their options. Given it was the first T20I of the series, Pakistan did fairly well, and we can expect them to come back stronger after spending some time in the field to adapt to the conditions. You don't want to be 2-0 down with the series on the line, so expect Pakistan to bounce back, but it won't be easy in New Zealand's fortress. Also, every game counts with the World Cup less than six months away, and the conditions won't be significantly different from what they will get in the US and West Indies, so there's all the more reason to put your best foot forward On the other hand, New Zealand were spot on with their fielding - a major difference between the two sides - and bowled well using variations, including cutters, to great effect. Tim Southee was on top of his game and took four wickets to thwart Pakistan's chase. New Zealand will look to gain more winning momentum against the visitors, who are in a transition phase after a change in captaincy. Finn Allen, Daryl Mitchell, Kane Williamson, and Mark Chapman are in imperious form and made full use of the short boundaries at Eden Park. Fans got their money's worth in the first T20, and we can expect another jam-packed crowd this evening for what promises to be another fascinating contest between these two top T20I sides

However, I feel like they have a stronger bowling line-up for this match, with death overs specialist Zaman Khan given a go and Mohammad Wasim Jnr, who can clock 140s consistently and also bowl accurately, which is important on these wickets where the margin of error is slim.<strong> Rvel Zahid</strong> here to take you through all the action of this crucial encounter Haider: "It seems like this will be Azam Khan's last series, given his current performance" I'm not sure about that, but this is going to be an important game for him to press his case forward. The idea to bring him into the squad makes sense, given his decent run in the CPL. Maybe he is finding it tough to settle in at this level, and removing the gloves might just do the trick Pakistan announced their playing XI on the eve of the third T20I. Abbas Afridi has been ruled out of the game owing to a low-grade abdominal wall muscle strain <strong>Pakistan XI:</strong> Mohammad Rizwan (vc), Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Azam Khan (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi (c), Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Haris Rauf, Zaman Khan

Alex Malcolm poses the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/steven-smith-back-up-pacer-and-other-questions-australia-need-to-answer-in-new-zealand-t20is-1421638">questions that Australia need to answer</a> in NZ before the T20 World Cup. Richard A: "I hope Spencer Johnson gets a run tonight. He was great fun to watch in the BBL. In World Cup year, Kiwis need a challenge up against someone fast, smart, left-arm and mean. " Junaid Anwar: "Can Clarkson emulate those big hits against this Australian side is the big question, he has though the big advantage of starting  in a familiar condition in his home country." <strong>6.20pm</strong> Finn Allen has been in rollicking form but his opening partner Devon Conway finds himself in a slump across formats. Andrew McGlashan wonders <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/nz-vs-aus-can-devon-conway-shake-off-his-funk-to-fly-high-again-with-finn-allen-1421848">whether Conway can shake off his funk</a> to fly high again with Allen? <strong>6.15pm</strong> No Jimmy Neesham (Bangladesh Premier League). No Daryl Mitchell (resting). Step forward, Josh Clarkson. Josh, who? The <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/josh-clarkson-the-biggest-and-most-dangerous-hitter-in-new-zealand-1421695">biggest hitter in the Super Smash</a> in recent years, that's who. Clarkson, 27, is in line for his T20I debut, having made his ODI debut against Bangladesh last December. Clarkson's former room-mate Will Young is also part of the T20I side, having been named as a replacement for Tim Seifert who suffered an injury while training for Northern Districts earlier in the week. Matt Henry is out with hip soreness, with Wellington Firebirds tearaway Ben Sears coming in as his replacement. <strong>6.10pm</strong> Hello, everyone. How you doin? It's time to renew the Trans-Tasman rivalry. NZ vs Australia. First T20I. Sky Stadium, Wellington. With the T20 World Cup around the corner, this three-match series will be particularly significant for both teams. This is also the first time that the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/new-zealand-and-australia-to-now-play-t20i-series-for-chappell-hadlee-trophy-1421753">Chappell-Hadlee Trophy is on the line</a> in T20I cricket. I'm Deivarayan Muthu and I'll be joined by Alex Malcolm to bring you all the ball-by-ball action.
