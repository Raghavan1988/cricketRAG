<strong>Looks out, and given! Allen is walking but signals the T</strong>. Looks like Chase persuaded him there. All smiles in the SA camp. Did it strike him outside the line? No, the back of lengther hit him in front of off and would go onto crash into the stumps. Allen is another victim of trying to work it across the line. He went across towards fourth stump and tried clipping it with a loose right knee. Got hit on the knee-roll and that was goodnight

<B>holes out to deep midwicket</b> and Allen goes for a first-baller. Slower ball full on middle, and he toe-ends a shot over to the leg side.
