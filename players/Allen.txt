Finn Allen and Devon Conway make their way out in the middle. Shaheen Afridi is ready on his bowling mark. Let's get this show on road! <strong>Saim Ayub:</strong> It's just the instinctive way of play, it's a beautiful environment and conditions are batting friendly, it's difficult for bowlers to defend and I enjoyed my batting. It's just my natural game and I don't want to change that. Yeah, always ready to bowl, you can suggest that to captain (chuckles) Babar Azam had a good outing in the first T20I and thumped a half-century Samina: "The only problem that I could see in Babar's batting in T20 is that he makes his plan a day before the match and does not modify it according to match situation. When team needs a strike rate of 100 from ball 1. Your 100 SR might cement your place but not helping the team. Same goes for Imam ul haq in all formats." Shahzeb : "Rizbar is the best opening combination for Pakistan in t20Is. On any day, against any opposition, chasing any target, you will depend on these two only, not on some sloggers. They need to persist with the same combination who has given them so much success in past few years." AB: "What happened to Imad Wasim, why isn't he playing? I was thinking Rizwan, Saim, Babar, Fakhar, Iftikhar, Pace Allrounder, Imad/Shadab, Abrar, Shaheen, Naseem, Haris for the WC" Shhazil: "Waiting to see if Haris Rauf can create any impact in this match???.. or should he replaced with more deserving likes of wassem and zaman" <strong>New Zealand XI:</strong> Finn Allen, Devon Conway (wk), Kane Williamson (c), Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Ish Sodhi, Ben Sears <strong>Shaheen Afridi:</strong> Abbas debut was a positive sign, hope he continues in that manner. We have to improve more in fielding, this wicket looks fine, ground measurement is decent and this match will be good, going with unchanged team <strong>Kane Williamson:</strong> I thought first half was good, bowlers executed their plans well. We start again and go back to what's in front of us, different venue and different conditions. <strong>Mitchell Santner comes in for Matt Henry</strong> Heads is the call and Shaheen Afridi wins the toss.<strong> Pakistan will bowl first. </strong> Sajjad: "Am I the only one who thinks Haris is operating on goodwill alone right now. I know "pace, pace hai yaar" but he needs to evolve with slower deliveries and offcutters. Otherwise Naseem will take over his slot instead of the one currently occupied by Abbas Afridi." Variations are very important in T20 cricket and indeed pace is not enough to thrive in this format Haseeb: "Saim Ayub, Riwan, Babar/Fakhar, and M. Haris will be the top 4 choices for World Cup." It's humid and there is a bit of cloud cover. It's a harder and faster track; the ground staff said it's one of the hardest surfaces they have prepared. It will offer good bounce and 190 seems to be a par score here <strong>6.27pm:</strong> Toss and New Zealand XI are coming up shortly. Hang around Deeps: "Pak team is not utilizing the talent of Fakhar properly, he should open the innings with Saim, Rizwan is much better in middle order. " Farzam : "Pakistan have a strong batting line-up and depth. However, the major decision for the World Cup will be the lower middle-order and bowlers. Inevitably, when Naseem is healthy we will play Naseem, Shaheen, Haris Rauf as our 3 pace bowlers with Saim, Rizwan, Babar and Fakhar as the top 4. That leaves 4 spots: for ifthikar, and the other 3 are up for grabs. Those final 3 spots in the playing 11 will be key. Will need a lower-order hitter than two all-rounders (likely one of or both as spinners?)" Sajjad : "Zaman Khan is the future star of Pakistan team he should be included in the team" <strong>Tim Southee</strong> became the first player to pick up 150 wickets in T20I cricket. He got to the milestone in his 118th match. New Zealand have been hit by an injury as Josh Clarkson has been pulled out of the squad owing to a shoulder injury <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/will-young-to-replace-josh-clarkson-in-nz-squad-for-third-t20i-vs-pakistan-1416515">Young to replace injured Clarkson in New Zealand's squad for third T20I</a> Pakistan are going with an unchanged line up <strong>Pakistan XI:</strong> M Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Azam Khan (wk), Aamir Jamal, Usama Mir, Shaheen Afridi (c), Abbas Afridi, Haris Rauf <strong>6.10pm:</strong> Hello cricket enthusiasts and welcome to the second the second T20I of the five-match series between New Zealand and Pakistan in Hamilton. Rvel Zahid here to take you through all the action tonight New Zealand played in an ultra-aggressive mood with the bat, decimating Pakistan's bowling attack in the series opener. Anything loose was duly sent to the boundary rope as New Zealand posted a mammoth 227 the other day, which proved to be out of reach for Pakistan. Pakistan deviated from their most successful opening pair of Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, with Saim Ayub opening the batting and former Pakistan captain Babar Azam batting at No.3. Saim Ayub batted beautifully and played some eye-catching strokes, including his incredible trademark no-look flick over fine leg. Unfortunately, he was run out in the third over. It looked like he was given a license to go all guns blazing in the powerplay, and he made good use of the fielding restrictions. Ayub has been brilliant in franchise tournaments over the last year and will be aiming to carry on his good form; he has been given a second chance to cement his spot in the national team. Abbas Afridi had a great debut, he took three vital wickets, as his back-of-the-hand slower deliveries were hard to pick. He showed hardly any signs of nerves in his first international appearance for Pakistan. Meanwhile, Aamer Jamal leaked plenty of runs and was a little wayward, and Usama Mir had a poor outing as well. Pakistan are trying to find the right combination before the T20 World Cup and are experimenting with their options. Given it was the first T20I of the series, Pakistan did fairly well, and we can expect them to come back stronger after spending some time in the field to adapt to the conditions. You don't want to be 2-0 down with the series on the line, so expect Pakistan to bounce back, but it won't be easy in New Zealand's fortress. Also, every game counts with the World Cup less than six months away, and the conditions won't be significantly different from what they will get in the US and West Indies, so there's all the more reason to put your best foot forward On the other hand, New Zealand were spot on with their fielding - a major difference between the two sides - and bowled well using variations, including cutters, to great effect. Tim Southee was on top of his game and took four wickets to thwart Pakistan's chase. New Zealand will look to gain more winning momentum against the visitors, who are in a transition phase after a change in captaincy. Finn Allen, Daryl Mitchell, Kane Williamson, and Mark Chapman are in imperious form and made full use of the short boundaries at Eden Park. Fans got their money's worth in the first T20, and we can expect another jam-packed crowd this evening for what promises to be another fascinating contest between these two top T20I sides

Abbas Afridi has been ruled out of the game owing to a low-grade abdominal wall muscle strain <strong>Pakistan XI:</strong> Mohammad Rizwan (vc), Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Azam Khan (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi (c), Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Haris Rauf, Zaman Khan

Starts off with an inswinging delivery on a slightly shorter length on middle, swiped through the line and looks like Babar Azam has hurt himself while diving at mid-on

<strong>Haseebullah takes a superb one at mid-on!</strong> On a length around middle, chipped in the air and Haseeb lunges forward and looks like he has taken a blinder, third umpire is having a look. Plucked his both hands out, diving full-length and the zoomed in view gives clear evidence that fingers are underneath the ball. Zaman gets the big fish! The lengths and lines have been good so far. Allen admonishes himself after hitting it straight to the debutant

Australia head to the middle. Starc will bowl the first over. Finn Allen on strike. <strong>7.03pm</strong> The players walk out for the anthems. Ananya: "Aus team is very good.  Marsh...Stoinis... Maxwell.. Short ... all can bowl.... that will relieve the pressure on the main bowlers who are world class themselves...!" No Stoinis on this tour due to a back injury. He has been bowling very well recently. Australia will have a challenge replacing his overs. Blake: "Given the strength of Australia's bowling lineup, How NZ fare against the 5th bowling overs could be key ( not that those bowlers are all that shabby either )" Vince: "How's the pitch?" Looks good. Very typical Cake Tin drop-in by the looks. Should be a lot of crowd catches. Thanks Deiva. Hello everyone. Plenty of excitement ahead of this game. Starc and Cummins are playing their first T20I since the 2022 T20 World Cup. Finn Allen and Devon Conway destroyed Australia's bowlers in the first game of the tournament that actually led to Starc being dropped for the last match. Jan: "Wasn't Trent Boult a part of the 15 as well? He isn't playing? " He's only joining the squad for the final two games in Auckland on Friday and Sunday. <strong>6.55pm</strong> Right, this promises to be an exciting game. Say hello to Alex Malcolm. <strong>6.42pm</strong> <strong>NZ win the toss and opt to bat in series opener</strong>. The <strong>big-hitting Clarkson makes his T20I debut for NZ</strong>. Ferguson also returns from injury, having missed the Super Smash final for Auckland. <strong>No Steven Smith for Australia.</strong> "Mitchell Marsh having a bowl in the warm-ups," Gnasher reports from the Sky Stadium. "He didn't use himself in the recent series against West Indies. Will be interesting to see if he has an over or two tonight. Australia don't have Marcus Stoinis to call on for extra seam overs." Tonka: "Like that they went with Inglis for 'keeper.  He has earned his place." <strong>Australia XI</strong>: 1 Travis Head, 2 David Warner, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell,5 Josh Inglis (wk), 6 Tim David, 7 Matt Short, 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Mitch Starc, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood <strong>NZ XI</strong>: 1 Finn Allen, 2 Devon Conway (wk), 3 Rachin Ravindra, 4 Glenn Phillips, 5 Mark Chapman, 6 Josh Clarkson, 7 Mitch Santner (capt), 8 Tim Southee, 9 Adam Milne, 10 Ish Sodhi, 11 Lockie Ferguson <strong>Mitch Santner</strong>: "Looks like a very good surface to be fair. Hopefully get some runs on the board and hopefully, it can swing around a bit later. We found in the last series if we get runs on the board we back ourselves to defend. <strong>Ben Sears and Will Young miss out today</strong>." <strong>Mitchell Marsh</strong>: "We were going to bowl first. Happy to do that. Hopefully, we can keep them to a low total. Cummins and Starc have bowled a lot but haven't played much T20I cricket. But they're so experienced and they'll do a job for us tonight. The boys have been batting well. Quite a settled line-up. Guys are in great form. I think it's going to be a great series. Two really good teams." Scott W: "Really looking forward to this series, NZ v Australia is always a good watch! Just spent my day out on the boat and was able to get home in time to catch the game." <strong>6.28pm</strong> Andrew McGlashan sets up the scene: "Good evening from Sky Stadium (aka the cake tin) where Wellington is putting on one of its good days. Bright blue sky albeit there will be a chill in the air later in the game. Both teams out doing their warm-ups and the crowd is starting to make its way in. Prospect of upwards of 20,000 tonight. Last time Australia played here was in the 2021 series during Covid-19. In one of those games, a Glenn Maxwell six put a hole in one of the seats. The spectators will want to be on alert tonight with plenty of big-hitters in both sides." <strong>6.25pm</strong> Australia will be fielding their strongest squad in a T20I series since the last World Cup with no players rested, though there are some injuries and family obligations that won't allow them to field their best XI in any of the three games. Alex Malcolm poses the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/steven-smith-back-up-pacer-and-other-questions-australia-need-to-answer-in-new-zealand-t20is-1421638">questions that Australia need to answer</a> in NZ before the T20 World Cup. Richard A: "I hope Spencer Johnson gets a run tonight. He was great fun to watch in the BBL. In World Cup year, Kiwis need a challenge up against someone fast, smart, left-arm and mean. " Junaid Anwar: "Can Clarkson emulate those big hits against this Australian side is the big question, he has though the big advantage of starting  in a familiar condition in his home country." <strong>6.20pm</strong> Finn Allen has been in rollicking form but his opening partner Devon Conway finds himself in a slump across formats. Andrew McGlashan wonders <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/nz-vs-aus-can-devon-conway-shake-off-his-funk-to-fly-high-again-with-finn-allen-1421848">whether Conway can shake off his funk</a> to fly high again with Allen? <strong>6.15pm</strong> No Jimmy Neesham (Bangladesh Premier League). No Daryl Mitchell (resting). Step forward, Josh Clarkson. Josh, who? The <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/josh-clarkson-the-biggest-and-most-dangerous-hitter-in-new-zealand-1421695">biggest hitter in the Super Smash</a> in recent years, that's who. Clarkson, 27, is in line for his T20I debut, having made his ODI debut against Bangladesh last December. Clarkson's former room-mate Will Young is also part of the T20I side, having been named as a replacement for Tim Seifert who suffered an injury while training for Northern Districts earlier in the week. Matt Henry is out with hip soreness, with Wellington Firebirds tearaway Ben Sears coming in as his replacement. <strong>6.10pm</strong> Hello, everyone. How you doin? It's time to renew the Trans-Tasman rivalry. NZ vs Australia. First T20I. Sky Stadium, Wellington. With the T20 World Cup around the corner, this three-match series will be particularly significant for both teams. This is also the first time that the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/new-zealand-and-australia-to-now-play-t20i-series-for-chappell-hadlee-trophy-1421753">Chappell-Hadlee Trophy is on the line</a> in T20I cricket.

<strong>10:16pm</strong> Right. We are back. Allen and Conway to open for NZ. 41 to get, and the Kiwis would want this opening pair to get them there. Kyewuta to take the new ball for Uganda. Can he get the ball to move like Boult and Southee did? Let's find out. Slip in place for Allen

<strong>appeal, and given! Allen cannot believe it, and he reviews it!</strong> Sprayed down leg. Allen looks to tickle it fine and seems to miss it. The umpire, though, thinks otherwise and reckons bat is involved. There was a sound as the ball went past the bat, but did the bat hit the ground or his boot on the way? <strong>There is a spike but Kumar Dharmasena says there is a gap between bat and ball, and that the bat brushed the floor, only to then go back and have another look. Now, he says there is a spike as the ball passes the bat, and the decision stands!</strong> The right decision might have been made eventually!

<B>1.16pm</B> The PNG players are out in the middle. How long will this chase take? You wouldn't rule out an attempt to take it down in the powerplay, given that NZ will want to bow out of this tournament in style. But, as Boult said, it's not the easiest of wickets for strokeplay. Let's wait and see... Craig re Ferguson's four maidens: "You said "at this level" but there is only one level of T20I matches." Fair... I meant at a T20 World Cup specifically (and yes, the other matches were Americas Zone qualifiers so technically they count!)

No, the back of lengther hit him in front of off and would go onto crash into the stumps. Allen is another victim of trying to work it across the line.
