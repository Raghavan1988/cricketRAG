Lockie Ferguson b Shaheen Shah Afridi 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0
<strong>Demolishes him with a yorker</strong>, goes full on middle, that's how you bowl at tailenders, he tries to whang him over midwicket but beaten by the pace and late away movement and that'll be the end of the match. Who would have thought 134 would be enough on this wicket but Pakistan have beaten New Zealand by a hefty margin of 42 runs after a brilliant bowling performance
<strong>Mitchell Santner, New Zealand Captain: </strong>The pitch slowed down a lot and we were pretty happy with the score. We just got outplayed in the second innings. The power play was very important on a slow wicket. We talk about trying to take it deep but it's good learning <strong>Iftikhar Ahmed, Player of the Match:</strong> I read the wicket and bowled accordingly, wicket was turning so I tried to bowl wicket by wicket. Yes it was decided that I will bowl today, Shaheen told me before the game and I was preparing for it. If captain wants, I am available to bowl as I have performed previously and will continue the same way. <strong>Shaheen Afridi, Pakistan Captain: </strong>Ifti (Iftikhar) is a very experienced player and he's always ready for the bowling but we wanted to give everyone a proper chance so we were planning to give chances to youngsters this series, we sorted out 16-20 players (for the World Cup). I want to thank everyone, the crowd was fantastic. <strong>Finn Allen, Player of the series:</strong> I've been trying to be a bit more consistent and assess the conditions quicker It was Pakistan's day, finally something to cheer about for the team and Pakistan fans alike. Shaheen Afridi wins his first game as captain. It was a power-packed performance and a convincing win in the last T20I of the five match series that ends on 4-1. The bowling delivered as a unit today and Nawaz was tight in the powerplay - smart move to introduce spin early on - that helped them built the pressure. Economical stuff from all of the bowlers and once Pakistan triggered a wobble at the top, New Zealand had little resistance to offer. Earlier, that crucial partnership between Mohammad Rizwan and Fakhar Zaman - where he played the role of the aggressor - helped Pakistan scrap their way to a fighting total. Babar Azam didn't come out to field today. He had issues with his hamstring in the last game and looked off-colour today. Pakistan enjoyed bowling in conditions that had plenty of assistance for the spinners, and the decision to bring on Iftikhar Ahmed paid rich dividends. It was baffling how he didn't bowl at all in the previous games, as Shaheen Afridi said they wanted to try newcomers, and the aim was to get the combination right. I'll leave that for you to make sense of because I, for one, cannot fathom a lack of concern about winning contests, even though it's a World Cup preparation series but winning is important too. New Zealand bossed the series for four games and dropped their in-form batter Daryl Mitchell for this one. Kane Williamson missed the last three games due to hamstring strain, and despite the shuffling, New Zealand were fiercely competitive, showing their strong bench strength throughout the series. Today, they didn't look comfortable against spin, in particular, and just went into a shell as the asking rate crept up. Pakistan finally breaks the hoodoo after a 3-0 defeat, albeit in a highly engrossing Test series in Australia, and four losses on the trot in New Zealand. New Zealand will now turn their attention toward the Test series against South Africa, while Pakistan players will get ready for the ninth edition of the Pakistan Super League, which will kick off on 17th February. We hope you will join us for more cricket coverage! Thank you for your company throughout the series. Until we meet again, it is goodbye from me, <strong>Rvel Zahid</strong>, and the entire team at ESPNcricinfo

Lockie Ferguson b Ellis 4 (7b 0x4 0x6 13m) SR: 57.14
bowled im! Full and straight. Ferguson swings. Misses. And that's the end of that. <b>Australia take a 2-0 lead and that means they will retain the Chappell-Hadlee series</b>
<B>10.22pm</b> That was comprehensive. Australia's bowling made it seem like this match was happening at the WACA. Not a ground so tiny and batting friendly that it is on occasion rubbished a bit. Eden Park, in addition to its 50m boundaries, also offers extra bounce and boy did those tall quicks made the most of it. Josh Hazlewood was pristine, bowling 17 dot balls in a 24-over spell, and that included a maiden. Even the captain Mitchell Marsh was able to keep hitting the deck and create problems, largely because of how well they held their line. When the ball keeps kicking up at you and you never get any room to free the arms, you feel trapped. NZ were trapped in this chase. Until next time, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Alex Malcolm. Take care and cheers. <b>Mitchell Marsh</b>: "Great win for Australia. Our backs were against the wall. I thought we were 50 short. But the way our bowlers came out and performed was outstanding. A collective effort. It's one of those grounds were you get lured into the short boundaries. The wicket was good. Had steep bounce which we should be used to. One of our mantras as a batting unit is to keep taking the game on and trusting our skills. I was proud of the fact we did that. I think all of our teams have been backed into corners in the last 12 months and we've found a way to get out of them. Tonight was another great example of that." <b>Mitchell Santner</b>: "We were pretty happy at halfway, especially after the start they got off to. Credit to the boys. To get wickets through the middle was key, it was the only way to slow them down really. Lockie showed his class again tonight. I thought Sears bowled extremely well. It was Gary [Stead's] decision [re batting at No.3]. It was unfortunate with Dev. But some good news, it's not broken. We'll see how he goes in a couple of days but obviously the Test matches coming up are pretty important as well. Wickets in the powerplay, they way they hit their hard lengths, playing those cross-bat shots were quite difficult. Maybe we could have soaked it up a bit longer." <b>Pat Cummins is the Player of the Match</b>: Dunno how I got this, but I'll take it. Yeah, batting wise, some came off the edges and I guess I'll take it. I love it [not captaining] Just going off to the boundary and coming in to bowl. I love it. [Why are Australia's bowlers so good?] First of all tonight, the wicket helped, had a little bit in it. Everyone had a good night. [Wicket like the WACA?] That's right, it had a bit sideways. Cricfan: "Unavailability for half the tournament is the only reason why Hazelwood isn't selected in the IPL! He is such a gem!"<hr>

Lockie Ferguson c & b Rashid Khan 2 (5b 0x4 0x6 3m) SR: 40
<strong>simple catch for Rashid, and the Afghanistan skipper finishes with a four-for!</strong> Tossed up devilishly on a length just outside off. Ferguson plants his front foot and plonks his bat in front of his pad. The ball hits his willow and then pops up for the easiest return catch Rashid will ever take! Afghanistan just one wicket away from an astonishing victory!
