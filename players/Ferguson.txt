It was Gary [Stead's] decision [re batting at No.3]. It was unfortunate with Dev. But some good news, it's not broken. We'll see how he goes in a couple of days but obviously the Test matches coming up are pretty important as well. Wickets in the powerplay, they way they hit their hard lengths, playing those cross-bat shots were quite difficult. Maybe we could have soaked it up a bit longer." <b>Pat Cummins is the Player of the Match</b>: Dunno how I got this, but I'll take it. Yeah, batting wise, some came off the edges and I guess I'll take it. I love it [not captaining] Just going off to the boundary and coming in to bowl. I love it. [Why are Australia's bowlers so good?] First of all tonight, the wicket helped, had a little bit in it. Everyone had a good night. [Wicket like the WACA?] That's right, it had a bit sideways.
