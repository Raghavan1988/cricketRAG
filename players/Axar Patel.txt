<strong>holes out to long off!</strong> Markram gives it a bit of air on a full length on off stump, and Axar cannot resist the temptation to have a pop at it. Does not get to the pitch of the ball, though, and has to reach out, meaning that the ball eventually hits the lower part of the bat. Long off runs in from the fence and completes the catch sliding forward. <strong>India 186-8 now!</strong>

picks out deep midwicket! The slower ball has done the trick. Axar is looking to whip it over the longest boundary but there's no timing or power. Got to wonder if it was needed at this stage, especially with Sanju dismissed in the previous over.
