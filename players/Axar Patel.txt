<strong>cleans him up!</strong> Axar danced down the wicket but misses a straight one which crashes into the stumps. The pressure had built after a good over and a half from Pakistan since the PP and this shot was never really on. <b>Pakistan have the wicket they'll feel they deserve</b>

Axar Patel run out (†Rahmanullah Gurbaz/Naveen-ul-Haq) 12 (6b 2x4 0x6 11m) SR: 200
Slower one into the pitch. Very short, wide-ish line, beats the pull. Keeper lobs it really high but Naveen is able to collect it run back and beat Axar on the race to run him out
Time for the innings break. In the meantime, imagine this: Your team is leading a major football game against all odds against massive favourites, and you are brought on to protect a 1-0 lead. In 4 minutes, you watch it become 1-1 and then score an own goal. Does it get any worse? A normal man would have crumbled… but a normal man doesn't get nicknamed Spartacus. This is how Klaus Gjasula went <a href="https://www.espn.in/espn/story/_/id/40390296/euro-2024-moment-day-klaus-spartacus-gjasula-goes-villain-hero-epic-style" target="_blank"> from villain to hero in epic style</a>. Surath: "Good score! only way AFG chasing this down is with a big score from Gurbaz. that won't happen with the likes of Brumrah and Arshdeep. Kuldeep will pitch in with 5 wickets today and you heard it first from me! " Papu : "Maybe Jadeja will prove me wrong with his bowling but I think Samson should play in his place. " <strong>Suryakumar Yadav</strong>: I've practised that and have played a lot there. I enjoy batting in 7 to 15, that's where teams try to wrest control. I started chewing my gum even harder when Virat got out. But I have experience and knew lhbs were coming in. It was important to keep the intent positive. Rohit inspires me, he understands my game. Total is good, happy with it. Let's see what happens. <strong>12:20pm</strong>: Great score for India considering the pitch. It didn't have grass and was slow but SKY wasn't. His fifty made the difference, Hardik offered good support too. The allrounders take them over 180. Afghanistan's bowlers were good. Farooqi got the early wicket. They kept Kohli down, didn't let Rishabh take off. But India MacGyvered along with positive shot-making. Rashid was the pick of the bowlers, he got a three-for. Big ones too - Kohli, Pant, and Dube. Omarzai was the weak link. Noor couldn't have a day out. The last five overs went for 55, brought about four wickets too.
