Tanaka Chivanga b Hume 6 (4b 1x4 0x6 10m) SR: 150
<strong>Yorked!</strong> Hume picks up his first ODI four-for as he fires in a rocket on middle and off as Chivanga has a mighty swing at it. Has his arm up in celebration as Zimbabwe are bowled out for 197 - their highest score in this series
<b>2.30pm</b> It wasn't the best, but still an improved batting performance from Zimbabwe on a slow and low pitch in Harare. They have got to 197 in 40 overs, after a two-hour delay interrupted play. Joylord Gumbie batted well for his 72 before he was run out. He had an important partnership with skipper Raza, who hit a quick 37. Wellington Masakadza gave Zimbabwe impetus at the end. Campher and Hume picked up four-wicket hauls while Mark Adair bowled excellently, especially with the new ball. Ireland now need 198 to make it 2-0. Join us soon for the chase!
