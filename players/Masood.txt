Chad: "I am coming to the Test tomorrow so the best scenario for me would be for Pakistan to be bowled out by the tea break or just after and then Australia 0/60 at stumps. And then either a century by Warner, Khawaja or Smith would be great!" Rohaan: "It is so disheartening to watch this Pakistan team play. They've relegated themselves to being a top team only in T20s. They've become a B-side in ODIs and Tests. The cause is years of mismanagement and lack of vision."

That's majestic! Short but not that short for tall Shan Masood. A bit leg-sidish and he unfurls a gorgeous pull. Slinks back and pulled it away with a lot of power and fizz through backward square.

<strong>Squealing for an LBW but umpire shakes his head! </strong> Good length ball, skiddy, jags back and rapped on the front pad, Australia decide to use their review. No deflection on snicko. Pitching outside off<strong>, impact is outside so that's that</strong> Incredible delivery nevertheless, came back sharply and he did okay to shield his stumps
