One ball to face for Taijul this over. Fernando goes back to over the wicket

too short and too wide. A bit of a waste really because Taijul could leave it alone comfortably

Vishwa to start things off with the ball, Taijul on strike. <B>9.58am</b> Alright the players are in the middle, we're almost ready for the days play. Isam also brings good tidings: "Bright and beautiful here today. Everything is picture perfect." <B>Pitch report</b>: "The grass, it's burnt off really. Some areas a dry and bare, some have a covering of green," says Russell Arnold. "That would mean when the ball hits the different areas it has to act differently. More of a concern are the cracks, hitting the edges of them again there can be variable bounce, it can crumble. The spinners will come into it. It's gonna get harder and harder to bat. Yesterday Sri Lanka did all the hard work, today it's going to be Bangladesh's turn. Take a leaf from how Dhananjaya and Kamindu played, you gotta attack the ball." Aquib Mohammed : "@Madushka Maththews and Lahiru Kumara were runout, and Tajul claimed the Jayasuriya wicket. I think the rest were claimed by seamers" --- Thanks for keeping me honest guys. Went to the kitchen this morning and to my horror, the coffee was over. Sajith: "SL need to take 2-3 wickets early in the morning.Pitch will surely support seamers in the early part of the first session.If Bangladesh can play the first hour without loosing wickets then they can try to push for a lead.This could be an exiting test match anyway." Akindu: " Ironically SLs tail collapsing put them much ahead in the game.If the tail wagged longer theyd have added some 20 runs but those 10 overs yesterday gave them 3 wickets AND the surface is good in the morning so they can take more today." Saleque Sufi: "Bangladesh batters must apply themselves and bat according to the merit of the ball. Surviving session one without losing two many wickets will be the key. Wicket will get better when the shile of the red ball goes . Hope Bangladesh batsmen bats sensibly " There were also centuries for DDS and Kamindu, with the latter's also his first and coming in just his second Test. The catch though was that he'd had to wait nearly two years between his first and second red-ball matches for the national side, and speaking after the game he spoke of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ban-vs-sl-1st-test-kamindu-mendis-scores-his-first-test-century-i-worked-tirelessly-to-get-to-this-point-1425774">tireless work he had been putting in</a> to be ready for when he got his next opportunity. Day one of course was one that belonged to the fast bowlers - 13 wickets fell and the seamers grabbed 10 of them (two were runouts and just one to a spinner).

<strong>12:03pm</strong> Largely Sri Lanka's session, with them sending three front-line batters back to the shed. Kumara got it all underway by accounting for Mahmudul. Shahadat looked good at the crease during his vigil but perished to a superb Kumara delivery. Litton, too, scored freely while he was around, only for Kumara to return and breeze through his defences. Despite everything that has unfolded at the other end, <b>Taijul</b> has remained unperturbed. He has shown good discipline to keep the good balls out and has not tried anything unnecessary. Bangladesh will need Mehidy and the rest of their lower order to now show similar application if they are to get close to Sri Lanka's first-innings total. Speaking of Sri Lanka, <b>Kumara</b> was the star of their show. His nagging length kept him in the game at all times. Jayasuriya bowled tidily too, even if he did not look very penetrative. Rajitha, though, was off the field for a while due to a niggle and seemed to lack rhythm when he came back. That could yet come into play if Bangladesh bat better after the break, but with just four wickets left to take, Sri Lanka will be fancying their chances of getting this done soon. Madushka will be back in half an hour to take you through the post-lunch session.

<B>And Taijul's sojourn comes to an end!</b> This one was fuller and wider, entices that flamboyant drive. But he's reaching for it and this time the edge is found. Mendis completes a good take to his left

Rajitha to replace Vishwa Shibbir : "how many times we have seen a batsman holding the match together and the tailenders around him are falling one by one.Here we have the opposite scene where a tailender is holding one side and proper batsmen are busy in coming and going. "

Play and a miss! This was a good length outside off and Taijul goes for a slightly more ambitious shot, looking to drive this on the up

Last ball coming up. What does Kumara have up his sleeve?

back of a length outside off. Taijul spars at it away from his body and jabs it towards backward point. <strong>And that will be stumps on day two!</strong>
<strong>5:40pm</strong> That will be all from us for day two. We will be back at it tomorrow and it should be a fascinating watch with Bangladesh's batters longing for a riposte after spending almost 160 overs in the field across the first two days. Until then, this is goodbye from all of us here at ESPNcricinfo. Take care, folks! <strong>5:35pm</strong> A decent passage of play for Bangladesh, although they would have ideally liked to have all ten wickets intact. Zakir showed good intent at the start and was able to buckle down as the day neared completion. Joy looked in nice touch too but was undone by a Lahiru Kumara special. Speaking of Kumara, he was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers. He found the right line and length almost immediately. Jayasuriya's spell was not shabby either, and he induced the odd false stroke. Asitha and Vishwa, though, could not use the new ball as adeptly, either bowling too full, too short or too wide. The good thing for the visitors is that they can now recalibrate and come back fresh tomorrow, with this ball still only 15 overs old. Bangladesh still have a long way to go to overhaul Sri Lanka's first-innings score. These 15 overs, however, will have given them confidence that they can keep the visiting bowlers at bay tomorrow, and gain a substantial foothold in this encounter.

Morning again everyone. Bit of a stalemate in that first hour - SL bowling well, but Bangladesh not budging. Will things liven up before lunch? Thushanka: "Going with 3 seamers in this pitch was a bad idea. If SL want to go with one spinner they should have gone with off spinner insted of left arm spinner. Because 4 out of 5 top order batsmans are left handers." They do have the part-time offspin of Dhananjaya de Silva in their ranks, Thushanka, but DDS has so far been reluctant to bowl himself much. Perhaps we'll see a few overs from him later in the day, especially if Bangladesh continue to bat well. Here's Vishwa, coming over the wicket to the leftie Taijul.

the inducker is wreaking havoc here! Again a stump is out of the ground (off stump this time) after jagging back between bat and pad. This is bowled from wide of the crease over the wicket again, and once more the movement off the pitch back at the stumps is too much for the batter to deal with. Vishwa is helping Sri Lanka get a tight grip on this match.
