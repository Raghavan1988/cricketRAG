Sadeera Samarawickrama b Maharaj 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0
<b>two in two!</b> Sri Lanka are falling apart. This was not necessarily a great ball, and not even an aggressive shot. This is a quickish delivery headed towards off, and Sadeera, without a lot of foot movement, tries to squirt this through off. He lets the ball slip between bat and pad though, and it clatters into off. Uff, Sri Lanka are struggling bad.

<strong>Driven through extra cover, that'll complete Sri Lanka's eight-wicket win</strong>. Was pitched up, Samarawickrama slid leg side of the ball and eased it along the ground. Long-off needed time to cut it off and the batters jogged back.
Sri Lanka's players pose in front of the Winners' banner and are all smiles. It's been a comprehensive win in tough times. They'll hope to carry it forward in the T20Is in three days. Hope to see you then. It's goodnight for now from me, Ekanth, on behalf of my co-commentators, S Sudarshanan and Himanshu Agrawal, and our scorers, Ranjith P and K Vairavan. <strong>Kusal Mendis, Sri Lanka captain</strong> speaks Sinhalese with Roshan Abeysinghe, who summarises the chat at the end. Says the skipper's happy with the win. He complimented the batting of Liyanage and Asalanka. Very pleased with the way the bowlers have done too. He's very confident with the job going forward. <strong>Craig Ervine, Zimbabwe captain</strong>: Didn't go well today. Had a decent start before the rain, Hasaranga was special. Our bowlers did well, hit good areas but couldn't get on top. During the day, conditions were easier to bat. Got difficult as the evening went on. T20s starting at 6:30 will be interesting. Our options against spin has been limited. Hope to work on that heading into the T20s and be able to score freely. <strong>Janith Liyanage, POTS</strong>: I feel really pleased, very happy. I've been performing well in the domestic season. Trusted myself to carry that here. I don't mind playing at any position as long as I do what's required for the team well. Step up to the international stage has been good. Credit to Zimbabwe, who put up a good fight. <strong>Wanindu Hasaranga, POTM</strong>: I came back after a few months. I'm good, thanks to everyone who supported me. I last played the LPL and haven't played since. I've worked hard to come back again, played two domestic games before today. Happy now. We have a balanced T20 side. As a captain, I hope to do our basics well. I don't think captaincy will affect my performance, I have been able to lead Kandy to victory in the LPL. Joe: "Wonder if Hasaranga can get player of the series playing only 1 game " Not sure, he should be the POTM. It'll be confirmed in the presentation that's coming right up. <strong>10:18pm</strong>  A cakewalk to seal the series for the hosts. Captain Mendis rolled seamlessly in the chase and it was set up by Hasaranga, who bulldozed the batting either side of rain. It meant that Ngarava and Muzarabani, who bowled jaffas every now and again, couldn't build scoreboard pressure. Mendis took on anything loose. Shevon Daniel, on ODI debut, had to work hard and didn't get going but let his skipper speed ahead. Samarawickrama joined late to finish with a red inker.

walks down, and swipes this length ball outside off over midwicket. The ball sails over the man inside the circle, and beats deep square leg to his left. With that, Sri Lanka win by seven wickets, and more than 14 overs left
So we wrap up with the ODI leg of the tour, which also goes Sri Lanka's way after their win in the one-off Test. They take the series 3-0, and Afghanistan take home the little periods of fight and determination - like turning 55 for 5 to 339 for 6 in the first ODI. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-3rd-odi-1416076/match-report">Madushka's report</a> for the day is up, in case you missed any of the action, as this is Himanshu signing off on behalf of Fidel, Chandan and Vairavan!

The next World Cup is in South Africa and we've got a few years before that, but this is the start of our preparation. Right through this series we've had batters in form, and they did well. I'm really thankful to the crowd who came to support us, and to the curators and those who worked on the pitch. We got the surfaces that we wanted." <strong>Hashmatullah Shahidi</strong>, the Afghanistan captain: "The result didn't go our way. Sri Lanka played really good cricket in all three departments, so credit goes to them. We didn't have enough runs. The bowlers also didn't bowl according to the plan. They (Rashid and Mujeeb) are the main bowlers of the team. If they were with us, it would have been better. I'll not be a part of the T20I series; I wish best of luck to the team. Hopefully our team does come back in that series." <strong>Pathum Nissanka is the Player of the Match and the Player of the Series</strong>: "I had no idea about getting to 2000 the fastest of any Sri Lanka batter. I'm really thankful to my father who was my first coach. We got a good wicket to bat on, and we got a good start through Avishka and myself, so we just continued in that vein." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> Joe: "Nissanka will get POTM, and POTS as well" --- No prizes for guessing Mark: "This is brutally one-sided. Afghanistan have some issues to address." <strong>9.18pm</strong> A crushing way to complete a commanding 3-0 series sweep. A whole lot of 88 deliveries remain, as the chase of 267 is wrapped up at a run rate of more than seven runs an over. While Avishka, with 91 off 66 balls, was aggressive, Nissanka was more nimble at the beginning; but as the pair spent more and more time, even Nissanka drove and swiped his way to 118 from 101 deliveries. An effortless victory, giving the feeling that nothing was impossible had they been batting first. Hang around for the presentations.

Sadeera Samarawickrama hit wicket b Naveen-ul-Haq 51 (42b 5x4 0x6 75m) SR: 121.42
<strong>a hit wicket to end the innings!</strong> Slower delivery dug into the track outside off. Grips in the surface and comes off much slower than Samarawickrama expects. He swings wildly and misses. Knocks over the bails as well in the process, and Afghanistan finish their bowling innings with two dots!
<strong>8:40pm</strong> So, Sri Lanka have gotten the 180-plus score their captain had asked for at the toss. Much of the tone was set at the top of the order, with Mendis and Nissanka blazing away inside the powerplay. There was a brief lull post it, though, and the innings was only revived when Hasaranga smashed 22 off 9. That knock helped Sri Lanka maintain their run-rate through the middle overs, despite not capitalising on the momentum immediately. Towards the end, Mathews took matters into his own hands, carving his way to an unbeaten 42 off just 22 balls. Samarawickrama, who walked in at 4, did his bit too, batting until the last ball and ensuring that Sri Lanka did not fall apart. Not much to shout about from an Afghan perspective. Nabi was the pick of the bowlers but the others travelled. This pitch has a bit in it for the bowlers but given Afghanistan are playing an extra batter tonight, they will feel they can have a real crack at this. Join us in a bit for the run-chase!
