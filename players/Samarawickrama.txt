Join us in a bit for the run-chase!"}]<strong>8:40pm</strong> So, Sri Lanka have gotten the 180-plus score their captain had asked for at the toss. Much of the tone was set at the top of the order, with Mendis and Nissanka blazing away inside the powerplay. There was a brief lull post it, though, and the innings was only revived when Hasaranga smashed 22 off 9. That knock helped Sri Lanka maintain their run-rate through the middle overs, despite not capitalising on the momentum immediately. Towards the end, Mathews took matters into his own hands, carving his way to an unbeaten 42 off just 22 balls. Samarawickrama, who walked in at 4, did his bit too, batting until the last ball and ensuring that Sri Lanka did not fall apart. Not much to shout about from an Afghan perspective. Nabi was the pick of the bowlers but the others travelled. This pitch has a bit in it for the bowlers but given Afghanistan are playing an extra batter tonight, they will feel they can have a real crack at this. Join us in a bit for the run-chase!
