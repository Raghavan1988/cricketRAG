c Jansen b Markram
Anil Sah c Jansen b Markram 27 (24b 3x4 1x6 25m) SR: 112.5
Jansen takes a very good catch and South Africa get a breakthrough! Sah has been on the front foot and he takes on Markram. Full outside off and he looks to slog-sweep. The ball goes high, but doesn't go far enough. Jansen has to run in and to his left from long-on, but he gets under it and holds on as he tumbles.
It's still only been spinners with all the wickets today!
