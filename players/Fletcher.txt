Shot: STEERED
run scored: 1
Great pace off the pitch. Length over fourth, ball squared up the batter but he did well to try and defend it close to the body. Runs it to deep third

<strong>Off pole decked</strong>. Oh, that seamed in too. Phehlukwayo is pumped. That landed around a length in line with fourth and Fletcher stepped down and tried pulling across the line. A shot fraught with danger with the bounce being uneven. This one wasn't just low but also had lateral movement. He stood no chance

confident appeal for lbw by Fortuin, but it is turned down. Van der Dussen and Fortuin have a word... and <strong>South Africa review</strong>!  Fortuin bowled on the fuller side of a length on middle, and the ball seemed to go on with the angle from around the wicket. Fletcher went defending, and replays showed a clear inside edge. So South Africa lose a review

Fletcher usually bats facing the new ball and in the powerplay, but today finds himself in a different role in the middle overs facing spin.

<B>LBW given!</b> And for a rare occasion the batter does not review. Full ball on middle, with pace off. He tried to flick but misses it. Hits his pad and the umpire raises the finger.
