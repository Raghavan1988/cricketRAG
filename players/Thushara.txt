This time Thushara takes the blow on his pads. Full but angling past leg as Thushara moves away once more. He really isn't keen on being anywhere near the ball

Sri Lanka manage a leg bye to finish it. But Bangladesh have reviewed for lbw. This was a pace off full toss following the batter who was making room leg side. He failed to get his bat down and the ball struck his outstretched back leg. They are checking to see if there's any bat on that but there isn't. Impact anyway looked outside leg and that's what ball tracking confirms. Sri Lanka finish on 124
<b>9.15pm</b> Pathum Nissanka would have made you believe this is the kind of pitch where you get to 200. But for the rest of Sri Lanka's batters, it seemed to be a different tale altogether. Bangladesh's bowlers, led by young leggie Rishad Hossain, made the most of a surface that saw the ball grip and turn. Sri Lanka started brilliantly thanks to Nissanka, but could not keep up the momentum and in the end, their innings fizzled out quite meekly. But their bowlers will take some encouragement from how their Bangladeshi counterparts went today. Join Madushka in a bit for the chase. And until then, hop over to Providence where <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-new-zealand-14th-match-group-c-1415714/live-cricket-score">Afghanistan have New Zealand on the mat</a>. <b>Taskin Ahmed:</b> "It's a good start. Still not finished the game, after finishing the game we'll celebrate. We have kept them to a good total, we should chase it down. How they started in the powerplay, after that we came back really strong. Whole bowling unit did a great job. Wicket had little bit of help for the bowlers and I think we executed well. We are happy but now we need to finish the match. Proper cricketing shots will help us chase this easily."
