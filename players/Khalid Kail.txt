Zampa to continue after drinks Thanks Abhimanyu. Australia well on top then, is there any way back for Oman here? Looking at the rising required runrate and net runrate permutations, more likely to be an exercise in damage limitation from hereon.

tossed up on off, gets a good stride in but still has to reach for this as it's swept behind square leg

Sami: "Guess the Scots are gonna have to take matters into their own hands this Sunday". That ranks as Oman's worst Powerplay of the World Cup, by the way. Strong start for England, as Ayaan Khan - the run machine - comes out as Adil Rashid comes on

Khalid Kail st †Buttler b Rashid 1 (3b 0x4 0x6 6m) SR: 33.33
Big leggie, big sweep - misses completely. Buttler goes way out wide to gather and comes back to remove the bails at the second attempt... and Kail's foot is in the air! Great work from the England skipper - even if he did botch the first go - but terrible game awareness from the batter!
Callum : "As a Scotland fan, this is depressing… give us something Oman! "
