For what it is worth, Zimbabwe can now have five fielders outside the circle. Here is Ngarava

<strong>Adair seals the deal! Ireland take a 1-0 lead, and they have been full value for this win!</strong> Drops it short and Adair is waiting for it. Arches his back to create room and ramps it over the keeper's head. Smiles all around in the Irish camp, and <strong>with the first game being abandoned, Ireland cannot lose this series now!</strong>
<strong>4:35pm</strong> Right. That will be that from us for this game. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. The match report by Ashish will be up shortly, make sure you jump into it to recount all that happened today at the Harare Sports Club. Until next time, this is me, Shashwat, signing off on behalf of Ashish, Harshith, Sudeep and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care! <strong>Paul Stirling, Ireland captain:</strong> We are getting better with each game. Slightly disappointed we came off for rain the last game. (On Little's bowling performance) That was one of the best spells I have seen. It was backed up at the other end. Bowling in partnerships is key and we did that well today. (On the pitch) One of those surfaces where 200 was probably a good score. That Josh Little spell was the main difference. (On the third ODI) We wanted to go 1-0 up and we managed to tick that box. There is a series to win and we will come back hungry. <strong>Sikandar Raza; Zimbabwe captain:</strong> (On the batting display) Take nothing away from Josh Little. When you lose four wickets for 19, it is a rescue operation. That has unfortunately been a pattern (for us). Just hoping we can get a partnership at the start and get a good total on the board. It is one thing not to have quality cricketers like Craig and Sean. I have always said opportunities come at funny times and if you can capitalise, you can have a great career. Credit to Burl, Madande and Masakadza for the way they resurrected the innings. (On the bowling performance) Lots of inside edges and outside edges went against us, could not have asked for more from the bowlers. (On what he felt would have been par) We did not think we would get there (to a 200-plus total). I thought if we got there, it would be interesting but we could not get there. They chased it comfortably and easily, despite the bowlers giving their everything. (On Ryan Burl's availability) Burl is in with a 50-50 shout (to play the next game) but it is not looking very good. The doctors are keeping an eye on him. <strong>Josh Little, Player of the Match:</strong> Nice to get the team a win. Nice to have some personal success on a special day for me. The wicket in the first few games did not allow a lot of swing. Managed to beat the bat today a few times and it kept the ball new, fortunately managed to swing it. That (the in-swinger) is a decent option to the right-handers so that is definitely a plan. I was quite sore after the spell so hopefully I can get into the ice bath and be back for Sunday. <strong>4:15pm</strong> Ireland made heavy weather of that run-chase but in the end, they got the job done. That was largely down to Campher's 66, which helped Ireland consolidate after the early departure of Balbirnie. Tector, Tucker and Adair also played useful cameos, meaning that Ireland, despite losing six wickets, never really lost control of the run-chase. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, would feel gutted, especially after the way they bowled. Their lines and lengths were largely consistent and they kept asking pertinent questions. Muzarabani was the pick of the bowlers. Mavuta was not bad either with his variations in the middle overs. Ultimately, though, it came down to how many runs Zimbabwe had on the board and today, they just did not have enough to make the most of their tidy bowling display.

Mark Adair c Mohammad Amir b Shaheen Shah Afridi 1 (4b 0x4 0x6 5m) SR: 25
Throws it away! A thunderbolt climbing insanely off the deck in the channel, he tries to smash that through the off side and ends up edging it to Mohammad Amir at short third. Shaheen Afridi picks up his third, that's what Pakistan expects from him, the ace pacer, the leader of the pace attack. This has been a quality performance.

Round the wicket, looks like it's on a length and whooshed past the outside edge to the keeper, he has been the pick of the bowlers this evening

Over the wicket, banged in and it's a little wide of off stump, can't cut it away
