That will be that from us for this game. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. The match report by Ashish will be up shortly, make sure you jump into it to recount all that happened today at the Harare Sports Club. Until next time, this is me, Shashwat, signing off on behalf of Ashish, Harshith, Sudeep and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care! <strong>Paul Stirling, Ireland captain:</strong> We are getting better with each game. Slightly disappointed we came off for rain the last game. (On Little's bowling performance) That was one of the best spells I have seen. It was backed up at the other end. Bowling in partnerships is key and we did that well today. (On the pitch) One of those surfaces where 200 was probably a good score. That Josh Little spell was the main difference. (On the third ODI) We wanted to go 1-0 up and we managed to tick that box. There is a series to win and we will come back hungry. <strong>Sikandar Raza; Zimbabwe captain:</strong> (On the batting display) Take nothing away from Josh Little. When you lose four wickets for 19, it is a rescue operation. That has unfortunately been a pattern (for us). Just hoping we can get a partnership at the start and get a good total on the board. It is one thing not to have quality cricketers like Craig and Sean. I have always said opportunities come at funny times and if you can capitalise, you can have a great career. Credit to Burl, Madande and Masakadza for the way they resurrected the innings. (On the bowling performance) Lots of inside edges and outside edges went against us, could not have asked for more from the bowlers. (On what he felt would have been par) We did not think we would get there (to a 200-plus total). I thought if we got there, it would be interesting but we could not get there. They chased it comfortably and easily, despite the bowlers giving their everything. (On Ryan Burl's availability) Burl is in with a 50-50 shout (to play the next game) but it is not looking very good. The doctors are keeping an eye on him. <strong>Josh Little, Player of the Match:</strong> Nice to get the team a win. Nice to have some personal success on a special day for me. The wicket in the first few games did not allow a lot of swing. Managed to beat the bat today a few times and it kept the ball new, fortunately managed to swing it. That (the in-swinger) is a decent option to the right-handers so that is definitely a plan. I was quite sore after the spell so hopefully I can get into the ice bath and be back for Sunday. <strong>4:15pm</strong> Ireland made heavy weather of that run-chase but in the end, they got the job done. That was largely down to Campher's 66, which helped Ireland consolidate after the early departure of Balbirnie.
