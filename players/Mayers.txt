taken at deep square leg! Peter strikes in his second over too. Nearly a collision between deep square leg moving to his left, and fine leg to his right. Eventually, it was Rickelton at the former position who took it, as Mayers went pulling at this short ball on middle and leg. The ball went pretty high this time, and didn't have as much power as the hit off the last ball

bashed over the bowler's head! The bottom hand came off his bat, but the ball still went miles into the stands. It was the wrong 'un from Peter, who got the length ball to dip on to middle stump. The bat turned in Mayers' hands too, but it hardly mattered

The T20 World Cup is less than one week away where West indies play Papua New Guinea in Match 2. South Africa will play Sri Lanka in Match 4. We'll see you then. Bye bye! <B>Winning stand-in captain Brandon King:</b> "Happy with my own performance. Would've liked to carry my bat through the end though. We understand each others' games, playing few years together. Important 3-0 win, last series before the World Cup, so important preparation and good momentum going into the World Cup. Our bowling performances were very pleasing, we had consistency through it. Motie and other different contributors. Speaks well that a lot of our main players are missing. Can't wait to meet with the other boys before the World Cup." <B>Losing stand-in captain Rassie van der Dussen:</B> "Thoroughly disappointing. Not what we had in mind coming here. From the first game they were all over us. We couldn't adapt,  and today we couldn't find answers with the ball.  Not happy with that. The chat coming into today was that you can chat all you want but have to deliver in the middle. We couldn't do that today. Time for talking is done, we'll need our experienced people coming in to take more responsibility. There's no excuse. We were caught off guard how they played with the bat and they were better with the ball as simple as that. We were taught a few lessons.

"We've been working hard during the camp and in the series. Worked hard on our skills leading upto the World Cup. Just enforcing the basics. Tried in the first two games, didn't  work out but came today. Important to get shape before the World Cup. It's all about building the confidence.  Even the two games I didn't score, I was still feeling good. Want to keep on building till that first game. These are good signs that we don't have our full squad and still won 3-0 against South Africa." <B>4.44pm</b> A 3-0 series victory for the hosts in their last official series before a home T20 World Cup. Both sides missed a few key players so overall they were missing equally strong players, however over this week, South Africa were totally outplayed with big-ish defeats in all three games: 28 runs, 16 runs, and today by eight wickets and 6.1 overs to spare.<BR><BR>Today, it was a strong bowling performance led by Shamar Joseph and Gudakesh Motie that kept South Africa down to 163. Rassie van der Dussen's fifty and Wiaan Mulder's contribution were the only positives today.

Charles hit WI's third-fastest T20I fifty and stand-in captain Brandon King continued with a solid 44 too. Kyle Mayers with 36 put the finishing touch.
