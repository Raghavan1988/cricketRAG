Brandon King grabs the T20I series trophy and then walks across to his team-mates. Thank you all for joining us through these three games. The T20 World Cup is less than one week away where West indies play Papua New Guinea in Match 2. South Africa will play Sri Lanka in Match 4. We'll see you then. Bye bye! <B>Winning stand-in captain Brandon King:</b> "Happy with my own performance. Would've liked to carry my bat through the end though. We understand each others' games, playing few years together. Important 3-0 win, last series before the World Cup, so important preparation and good momentum going into the World Cup. Our bowling performances were very pleasing, we had consistency through it. Motie and other different contributors. Speaks well that a lot of our main players are missing. Can't wait to meet with the other boys before the World Cup." <B>Losing stand-in captain Rassie van der Dussen:</B> "Thoroughly disappointing. Not what we had in mind coming here. From the first game they were all over us. We couldn't adapt,  and today we couldn't find answers with the ball.  Not happy with that. The chat coming into today was that you can chat all you want but have to deliver in the middle. We couldn't do that today. Time for talking is done, we'll need our experienced people coming in to take more responsibility. There's no excuse. We were caught off guard how they played with the bat and they were better with the ball as simple as that. We were taught a few lessons.
