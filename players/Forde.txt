Forde is OUT! lbw
lbw b Hazlewood
Matthew Forde lbw b Hazlewood 7 (9b 1x4 0x6 7m) SR: 77.77
Looked good, yes, given lbw. Has Forde hit it? He reviews quickly. There is a spike on Hotspot. Snicko has to be brought in. Third umpire reckons there's a gap between bat and pad. It beat the full-faced push on the inside edge. Hit around the knee-roll in front of middle and Hawk-Eye thinks it'd go on to clip leg.

<b>it goes from bad to worse!</b> Short of a length, pulled towards mid-on, Forde sets off for the run. Chase isn't going. Forde slips as he's almost at the non-striker's end. No chance of getting back. The two batters arguing with each other. Bit of a shambles, really
Update from CA: Lance Morris [has] sustained a side strain. Morris will have a scan (timing TBC) to determine the extent of the injury.

Knuckle-ball? Maybe, comes in off a shortish length and Forde tries to launch a pull square of the wicket. Can only balloon it to Phehlukwayo running across in the deep
