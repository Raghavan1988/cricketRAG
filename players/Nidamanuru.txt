Mukkamalla was fielding very wide on the straight boundary and did well to cover as much distance as he did before flinging his body in the air to the left but it just grazes off his fingertips before going to the rope.

good length ball on off, guided defensively to backward point for a dot but Mukkamalla runs over the ball and turns a dot into a single. USA's fielding is becoming ragged once again like it has been the first two matches.

<strong>dropped!</strong> Mukkamalla can't hold onto a desperate effort charging across 30 yards from long-on. It was full on the stumps and Nidamanuru plays a loose drive in the air over Taylor. Mukkamalla was fielding very wide on the straight boundary and did well to cover as much distance as he did before flinging his body in the air to the left but it just grazes off his fingertips before going to the rope.

Drinks called. USA had Netherlands under a lot of pressure after the fall of the fourth wicket. But with Ali Khan off the field ill, they've been unable to find a quality fifth bowling option. Nisarg Patel's introduction has proven extremely ineffective and Nidamanuru and Edwards have milked him around for ones and twos with ease. The Dutch are back in control. USA's only realistic hope of coming back in this match is Ali Khan returning to the field, but he's been off for so long that it's doubtful he'd even be allowed to bowl. Here comes Shashwat Kumar back into the central commentary position to see you through to the finish.

<strong>Nidamanuru perishes!</strong> Tossed up nicely on a length on middle and off stump and Nidamanuru tries to smash it over cow corner. He does not get to the pitch of the ball, though, and gets a top edge that spoons up. Substitute fielder Paradkar settles under it at short fine leg and completes the catch!

spooned to deep third! Wow, even a leading edge travels as far as that. Nortje's pace, and the extra bounce available on the pitch, combine to send Nidamanuru back. Klaasen, placed on the shorter boundary, took a few steps forward and went low to complete the grab. Nidamanuru had closed the face of the bat to try and clip this short-of-a-length ball angling nicely into middle, but seemed to have done it too early. So the ball took the leading edge and flew off
