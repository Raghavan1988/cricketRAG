spooned to deep third! Wow, even a leading edge travels as far as that. Nortje's pace, and the extra bounce available on the pitch, combine to send Nidamanuru back. Klaasen, placed on the shorter boundary, took a few steps forward and went low to complete the grab. Nidamanuru had closed the face of the bat to try and clip this short-of-a-length ball angling nicely into middle, but seemed to have done it too early. So the ball took the leading edge and flew off

short and sharp, but wide called. Again there is considerable bounce off a shortish length on middle, as the batter leaps to try and poke, but misses
