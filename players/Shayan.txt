Drinks called. USA once again struggling mightily on the batting side as they are once again without captain Monank Patel, missing his second match in a row due to illness. Netherlands have been very disciplined in restricting the batters who have been put forward though, regardless of USA's talent level. Realistically, USA is on course for another severely below par total. It's up to Jahangir to get them to something that can battle with. Sabin: "Peter, you are always the one who publishes most comments but there hasnt been any during this stint. Why is that?"

half-volley on fifth stump, Jahangir goes to drive over mid-off and slices a drive high over backward point that clears the man there and beats short third as well to the rope. Not in control of the shot at all but still gets full value.

Ashraful : "USA has played a ridiculous amount of dot balls. You just can't play 5 dot balls consecutively after scoring a boundary first ball of the over.If not for all those dot balls, their runs could have been 50/60 more." This is a problem that has affected USA batting units for more than a decade. They struggle to rotate the strike, especially against spin bowling.

Jana Gana Mana first up, then Mary Millben with the Star Spangled Banner... good set of bellows. We are almost set for the off. <strong>10:19am</strong> Yuvraj Singh was out with the trophy. India are out for a group picture ahead of the anthems. About four minutes later, the teams walk out, with the big flags held behind by volunteers, for the anthems. Sea of blue in the crowd.

Monank has a niggle, should be back next game. Should be a good game, looking to win, which will be really good for us. Will play hard cricket. Everything good, good vibes in the camp. Monank is out, Shayan Jahangir in; Noshthush Kenjige out, van Schalkwyk in Rohit Sharma: Pitch has played better in the last two games. You gotta understand what you need to do, assess conditions quickly and let the game take over. Gotta constantly get better in your own game. Important to continue doing the good things that we have in the last two games. Pakistan game was great to play, bowlers came to the party. Expecting nothing different. Pitch will challenge in different ways, but it's all about responding and understanding what you need to do. <strong>Same team</strong> <strong>10am</strong>: Monank Patel is out with a left-shoulder injury, informs Neroli Meadows. Aaron Jones will replace him as captain. Rohit Sharma next to him for the toss. Rohit calls tails, he's right. <strong>India win the toss and will bowl</strong> <strong>Pitch report</strong> from Steven Smith: It's been a tricky wicket over the last week. Things have been similar; bowlers have bowled a hard length which has been challenging. Batters haven't been able to connect with cross-bat shots regularly, so will look to hit down the ground and go up and over when there's pace. Bowlers will try to hit a hard length and let the natural variation do its thing. Bowling first is the best way to go, you wanna know what you're chasing. Hopefully take early wickets and chase the total later on. Ten minutes away from the toss and Narsima says, "Batting first is advantage for USA. If India bat first, they have to file up more runs to take advantage and win. Then, If USA scores less, their run rate will go down drastically. If USA bat first, India will take light on their batting strength and may score less." India will look to be smart like they did vs Pakistan, where Pant's counterattacked. Rohit had also said before that game that they will have to hit bowlers off their lengths - something Pakistan didn't do against India. But very unlikely that'll happen today Nikita Chagani: "Hate to be a negative nancy but the weather in Florida looks pretty horrendous over the next few days. Any wash-outs would put India and USA firmly in the driver seat and it would likely be the end of the road for Pakistan and Ireland. " Shubha: "The very fact that India defended a low score is promising. It would boost the confidence of the bowling unit manifold" The pitch, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-can-vs-pak-when-will-pakistan-get-serious-about-winning-trophies-1438179">as Danyal Rasool wrote</a>, seems to take a personal affront to run-scoring. But then the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-pak-t20-world-cup-2024-rohit-sharma-jasprit-bumrah-and-the-art-of-defending-1437866">inconsistency in conditions is levelling the playing field</a> somewhat. The pitch is getting better but this is likely to be a low-scoring game. Bowlers will look to contain but a cameo from a batter could be the difference between two teams. Vishal Poojary: "Looks like lot of them are in a 'Karmbhoomi v/s Janmbhoomi' dilemma today :)" Indeed: Vishal: "I must say I am loving seeing our men in blue in ALL blue practice kits (with a dash of yellow true) on TV. I love my saffron but only with equal doses of white and green" ankur baid: "It's really heartwarming to read about current USA players talking with current India player and coach, who they would have meet many years ago, playing for same team.

Rohit calls tails, he's right. <strong>India win the toss and will bowl</strong> <strong>Pitch report</strong> from Steven Smith: It's been a tricky wicket over the last week. Things have been similar; bowlers have bowled a hard length which has been challenging. Batters haven't been able to connect with cross-bat shots regularly, so will look to hit down the ground and go up and over when there's pace. Bowlers will try to hit a hard length and let the natural variation do its thing. Bowling first is the best way to go, you wanna know what you're chasing. Hopefully take early wickets and chase the total later on. Ten minutes away from the toss and Narsima says, "Batting first is advantage for USA. If India bat first, they have to file up more runs to take advantage and win. Then, If USA scores less, their run rate will go down drastically. If USA bat first, India will take light on their batting strength and may score less." India will look to be smart like they did vs Pakistan, where Pant's counterattacked. Rohit had also said before that game that they will have to hit bowlers off their lengths - something Pakistan didn't do against India. But very unlikely that'll happen today Nikita Chagani: "Hate to be a negative nancy but the weather in Florida looks pretty horrendous over the next few days. Any wash-outs would put India and USA firmly in the driver seat and it would likely be the end of the road for Pakistan and Ireland. " Shubha: "The very fact that India defended a low score is promising. It would boost the confidence of the bowling unit manifold" The pitch, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-can-vs-pak-when-will-pakistan-get-serious-about-winning-trophies-1438179">as Danyal Rasool wrote</a>, seems to take a personal affront to run-scoring. But then the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-pak-t20-world-cup-2024-rohit-sharma-jasprit-bumrah-and-the-art-of-defending-1437866">inconsistency in conditions is levelling the playing field</a> somewhat. The pitch is getting better but this is likely to be a low-scoring game. Bowlers will look to contain but a cameo from a batter could be the difference between two teams. Vishal Poojary: "Looks like lot of them are in a 'Karmbhoomi v/s Janmbhoomi' dilemma today :)" Indeed: Vishal: "I must say I am loving seeing our men in blue in ALL blue practice kits (with a dash of yellow true) on TV. I love my saffron but only with equal doses of white and green" ankur baid: "It's really heartwarming to read about current USA players talking with current India player and coach, who they would have meet many years ago, playing for same team.

" <strong>9:30am</strong>: Two super-promising signs from New York: It's a bright and sunny morning, and <strong>Harmeet Singh and Saurabh Netravalkar are having a chat with Rahul Dravid</strong>. It's been going on for a couple of minutes and depicts the merging culture inherent in this contest. Five members in the USA squad have an Indian heritage, including <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/saurabh-netravalkar-and-harmeet-singh-two-mumbai-boys-living-the-american-cricket-dream-1438245">the aforementioned Mumbai boys are living their dreams</a>. Both teams are coming in with two wins and can seal a Super-Eight spot with one more today. Netravalkar, as I type, is now chatting with Rohit and then SKY, who greets him with a hug and a big smile.

They will have a significant edge and a major confidence boost going into the T20I World Cup. The USA have made excellent use of all the available factors, including pitch and wind direction. Netravalkar, Ali Khan, and Van Schalkwyk will be the backbone of Team USA's precise line-length bowling exhibition once more. However, Bangladesh has been finding it difficult to put on a great show during the series. At one stage, they had five wickets remaining and needed to score 21 runs off of 18 balls to win the second Twenty20 International. But once more, they gave way under duress against the disciplined USA bowling. Bangladesh is still awaiting the performance and solid start they need from their top order. Their final opportunity to play as a cohesive unit and put on a respectable display before the World Cup is today. Hello everyone! Welcome to live coverage of the third T20I match between the USA and Bangladesh on ESPNcricinfo, from the Prairie View Cricket Complex in Houston, Texas.
