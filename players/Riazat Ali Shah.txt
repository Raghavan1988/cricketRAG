length outside off. Riazat presses half forward and defends
This innings has gone nowhere so far. Uganda have been under the pump from the start and it has been more about survival than run-scoring for them. NZ have done the basics well and now that they find themselves in this position, would want to wrap up this innings quickly

<strong>beautiful bowling, and no Riazat rescue act for Uganda tonight!</strong> Fizzed through on a length on middle and off. Drifts in and then rags away after pitching. Riazat has not accounted for that much turn and tries to defend with an open bat face. Almost glides it off the face and Conway pouches it smartly behind the stumps!
