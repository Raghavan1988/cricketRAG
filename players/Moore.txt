Edward Moore c Conway b Henry 23 (50b 4x4 0x6 66m) SR: 46
<b>he's bounced him out</b>, Moore is gone! Bangs in a bouncer from around the wicket, the left-handed Moore hops on his toes, takes his eyes off the ball while sticking his bat out in front of his face. The ball rises and takes the edge, goes off the helmet and balloons towards short cover point where Conway dives forward from the ring to complete an excellent catch
South Africa three down and it's time for drinks. Bedingham walks out meanwhile
