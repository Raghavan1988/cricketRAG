<strong>five of the very best for Akeal Hosein!</strong> Another arm-ball that starts outside off and zings back into Waiswa. Like many before him, he has no idea about this. Plants his front foot and then plays outside the line. The ball sneaks past the inside edge and thumps him on the front pad. <strong>Kumar Dharmasena gives it out, and even though Waiswa has reviewed, this looked out. Clear gap between bat and ball.

<strong>another Boult appeal, but not given this time!</strong> Zipped in quite full, just outside off. Swerves back in and Waiswa, looking for the booming drive, seems to miss it. Clips the pads and then floats through to Conway, who catches it. <strong>New Zealand have reviewed this, with the umpire's decision being not out for the caught-behind.</strong> That could be out on two counts. If it has not hit the bat, lbw could be in play. <strong>No bat involved, and the impact is Umpire's Call, which is a very close call. Ball Tracking has the ball hitting the stumps thereafter but it does not matter after one parameter returns Umpire's Call!</strong> The original decision, just to reiterate, was not out on both the caught-behind and the lbw.
