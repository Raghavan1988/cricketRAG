Huge appeal as a very full delivery hits Taskin on the foot. Or did he get bat on that? Not given out, but Sri Lanka review. Wait, that's hit Taskin full on the toe. Brilliant yorker. Pitching on leg and that's hitting the stumps! Sri Lanka have two in two, and suddenly, this game has turned on its head!

Taskin, at No. 9, has to hit his first, most likely only, ball out of the ground

<strong>High full toss, will it be a no-ball? No, and Maharaj's praying. His prayers have been answered, in fact, as SA sneak a four-run win</strong> It was wide and he tried to heave it across the line. The line was outside off and he couldn't drag it, spliced it to cover and the celebrations followed.
Whatever the discourse around the New York pitch is, it sure is producing thrillers on tap. One umpiring decision might push some attention aside but the call can be lived with, as Shanto showed during the presentation. South Africa fans can rejoice that they're winning games defending totals and while chasing. Just two more games remaining in New York, and they'll be tomorrow and day after. Two night games tomorrow as well. Hope to see you as we Matt Stonie our way through the tournament. For now, it's goodbye from me, Ekanth, my co-commentator, Himanshu Agrawal, and our scorers, Chandan Duorah and M Venkat Raghav. <b>Aiden Markram, South Africa captain</b>: You're always pretty nervous in the final over in a game like that. It was always on a knife's edge, it can make you mentally tired. It's always nice to be in them though. Sometimes you get on the right side, sometimes not, but it's very entertaining. 19.5 (full toss) could've gone anywhere, could've gone two more metres further and we'd have had a different conversation. Like I mentioned, a few things went our way today, very fortunate on that to get on the right side. (Will Maharaj bowl the 20th over again) Depends on the situation, you want to drag the game as long as you can, so you use quicks to attack. Today was one of those days where the seamers were bowling well, we wanted to drag it to the end where anything could happen in the last over. We're putting Klaasen and Miller under pressure but they've been exceptional. They've gone back-to-back with crucial partnerships, got us to a score that's luckily enough to win but still one we could defend. Fantastic for Klaasy to get back in form. <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh captain</strong>: Everyone was nervous, but were confident when Jaker was there. It didn't happen but that's okay. Tanzid really worked hard last couple of games, we needed new-ball wickets and he showed his character. This is the match we should have won, we nearly did but the last couple of overs they bowled well. It can happen in cricket. Rishad is very good, he's bowled well in the last two games and in practice. We've struggled with legspin in 10-15 years but hope he goes far. Wherever we play, we get a lot of support. Hope it's the same in the West Indies. <strong>Heinrich Klaasen, POTM</strong> (On the finish) <i>Laughs</i> It was not so nice on the heart but glad to go over the line. The wicket is not great for strokeplay but David showed in the previous game how to bat on this wicket. Got info from him. We got a decent score but were 10 runs short. We got experience and more or less a one-day mindset till the 15-over mark. Hopefully we could've pushed on but not. Win will give big confidence for the boys, we've had three pressurised games now. We're through which is nice. One more to go and then onto the next phase. Mak: "A neck to neck game decided by strange rule. Horrible example!" Horrible is a bit harsh but the frustration is understandable. Rahul: "ICC... Please conduct Test championship finals in this NY pitch..." Stat from Sampath - Lowest target a full-member team failed to chase in men's T20Is (full 20-over game) 102 - ZIM vs NAM, Windhoek 2023 106 - WI	vs ZIM, Port of Spain 2010 114 - ENG vs WI, The Oval	2011 114 - BAN vs SA, New York 2024 116 - SL vs SA, Colombo (RPS) 2013 South Africa's new-ball bowlers weren't on the mark Anyway, South Africa were almost out of it, because of that ball and the penultimate ball, which should've gone out the ground. But Mahmudullah couldn't middle the full toss and Markram, cool as ever at long-on, took the match-sealing catch. The rest of the innings was as scrappy as expected on a tough deck. Bangladesh tried to be proactive wherever possible, stay in the game and finish it off. Of course, no one could score big or at a lightning pace but Hridoy and Mahmudullah almost took them through. Hridoy was a bit unlucky to get lbw in the 18th over, that went for just two runs, along with Mahmudullah, who fell on 19.5. <strong>2:01pm</strong> Oh boy, those non leg-byes. They could be worth a 1000. <strong>The fact is 16.2 was given out lbw, the decision was overturned, Bangladesh have never beaten South Africa in a T20I (streak is now 9-0) and in the end South Africa have all but qualified for the next round</strong>. Apparently, it's not a mathematical guarantee yet, but Nepal will have to win all thee, including games against against SA and Bangladesh, to get through. Netherlands, too can get to six, but need to beat Sri Lanka and Bangladesh for it.

Cos that was some breathtaking cricket on display! Dasun Shanaka in the end holds his nerve, grabbing two wickets and giving away just 8 runs in the final over to help Sri Lanka edge a nail-biter and take a 1-0 lead in this series. But this was a chase all about Jaker Ali, and before that Mahmadullah. Sri Lanka had done exceedingly well to put on 206 batting first, courtesy hands from Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama and Charith Asalanka, but with dew in full effect Sri Lanka's bowlers - particularly Matheesha Pathirana - struggled to contain Bangladesh. Angelo Mathews grabbed early wickets in the chase, and Bangladesh looked in danger of folding cheaply at times, but Mahmadullah and Jaker had other ideas striking a pair of blistering fifties to keep Bangladesh in the hunt.

For now though, on behalf of the team, this is Madushka signing out! <B>Wanindu Hasaranga</b>: "I watched the first two games in the dressing room, our boys played well throughout the series. The credit should go to the batters who batted really well, while the bowlers also defended very well. [Wicket was conducive to bowling?] Especially in the day game I trust my skills, and in a day game I know the wicket will grip so I trust myself. [Thushara] It's his first game this series, he bowled really well. This is a good series win for us and just think our bowling attack was too good for them. [preparing for the WC] This is our last series before the World, so we take a lot of confidence from this." <B>Player of the Series</b> goes to <B>Kusal Mendis</b> for 181 runs across the three games: "The wicket was a little two-paced at the start, some coming quick, some slow. It was quite hard to play in the first couple of overs. Then after the sixth over I was able to manage my game. [losing wickets put pressure?] Not pressure. I think Kamindu and Wanindu batted really well for a couple of overs, I played my own game. I played a couple of overs through singles and boundaries and Mathews and Dasun batted very well at the end. [happy with the series?] The batters and the bowling unit have done really well. Charith batted really well, as well as the fast bowlers and spinners. I'm very happy with the team." <B>Nuwan Thushara</b> is unsurprisingly the <b>Player of the Match</b> for his figures of 5 for 20, including a <B>hattrick maiden</b>: "I'm happy that I found my rhythm, and that I was able to do well the things that I'm good at and make an impact on the game. I'm really happy, it was the first hattrick in my life. In a match like this, I'm just pleased to be able to help the team." <B>Najmul Hossain Shanto</b>: "The way started they batted brilliantly, but we came back strongly specially in the last 4-5 overs. Credit goes to Nuwan Thushara the way he bowled, I think he bowled brilliantly. But we have to be careful going forward how we play in the first six overs. [Late recovery?] I think if you look at all three matches, we played some good cricket. Especially the way Rishad, Taskin and Mahedi batted, really happy for them. [positives ahead of the ODIs?] We can take a lot of confidence from this series, but that is a different format and we're looking forward to it." Time for the post-series presentation Palinda: "Thusharafor MoM and Kusal Mendis for POTS" AC: "Shanaka becoming a last over specialist, wonder he can do that against top order batters, excellent thinking behind his bowling at the depth" Saki: "Why not a 5 match series. This series was so entertaining!!!" --- Good question. Reckon Bangladesh might have preferred the ODIs with the Champions Trophy next year. If they were out of it as well, we very well might have seen more T20s. <B>6.36pm</b> Fireworks in the background as the players shake ends. So a hard fought series comes to an end with what was a comfortable win for Sri Lanka in the end. There were fireworks galore on the field too courtesy Rishad Hossain during his 30-ball 53, but it was little more than a footnote as the day belonged to Nuwan Thushara. In the side likely only due to Pathirana's injury, but a first over hattrick on his way to a five-for, completely derailed Bangladesh's chase and set Sri Lanka well on the way to victory. Kusal Mendis had earlier led the charge with a 55-ball 86 as Sri Lanka posted a competive 174 for 7. Bangladesh might have fancied chasing those down, but then Thushara happened.
