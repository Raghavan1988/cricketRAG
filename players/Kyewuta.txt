<strong>another big appeal, and another batter falls to the arm-ball!</strong> This has been WI's biggest bowling weapon tonight. The ball starts just outside off before coming in with the angle. Kyewuta does not get a big enough stride and does not pick the variation either. Plays all over it and the ball clips the flap of the back leg right in front of middle stump. Kumar Dharmasena raises his finger, and Kyewuta does not bother with the review!

<strong>that will be that! Uganda have been rolled over for 40!</strong> Looped up beautifully on a full length on middle and leg. Dips on the batter late and it is just too good for Kyewuta. He tries to flick it away but the turn takes the outside edge and Mitchell does the rest at slip!

Playing for pride, they won the toss and made the most of the conditions. Boult and Southee got it to hoop around corners with the new ball, denting Uganda multiple times in the powerplay. Santner then hoodwinked the batters with his changes of pace and his guile, with Ferguson and Rachin also among the wickets. Southee, arguably, was the pick of the bunch, with figures of 4-1-4-3. Nothing to shout about for Uganda. Only Waiswa got into double-digits and the gulf in quality, especially against a bowling unit of NZ's ilk, was evident. They did well to drag out their innings into the 19th over but the fact that they resorted to survival after the first few overs summed it up for them. NZ are well in control at the half-way stage and even that seems an understatement. After the disappointment against Afghanistan and the West Indies, they would want to get this done quickly and get on the board. Join us in a bit for the run-chase! <b>Tim Southee:</b> (On the team's bowling plans) In the last couple of games, it has been a tricky surface. Tried to bring the stumps into play and think we did that tonight. (On the conditions) Tough conditions. As a bowler, there is plenty on offer if you hit the right areas. Same for both teams, so it is about how you can adapt and figuring out what is a score you can defend. (On his bowling) Feeling really good. had a nice, little break after a busy coupled of years. Feel fresh and nice to get a breather leading into this.
