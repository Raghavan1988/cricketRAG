Slapped away! What a way to end the session. Length ball well outside off, McKenzie stands tall and hammers it through covers
<strong>12:03pm</strong> Australia's session but West Indies will not be too disappointed. The openers began steadily, albeit a bit streaky at times, but negotiated the new ball quite well. But once Cummins came into the attack, he made things happen like he always does. He dismissed both the openers before Hazlewood knocked Athanaze over. One thing West Indies could look at is their scoring rate but you can't fault them against this bowling line-up. Will they fare better after lunch? We'll find out in about half an hour with Gnasher on the hotseat. Matt: "When was the last time if ever that Australia had a quartet of bowlers with a minimum of 250 wickets a piece? McGrath / Warne era?" Never. This is the first time four bowlers in a Test XI have at least 250 wickets
