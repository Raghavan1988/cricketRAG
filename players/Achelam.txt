Uganda are trickling along at less than two runs per over. Can they somehow get up to 50 from here?

Fred Achelam lbw b Southee 9 (13b 1x4 0x6 16m) SR: 69.23
<strong>trapped in front, and that is a no-brainer for the umpire!</strong> Back of a length on middle and off. Nips back in a smidgen and keeps low. Achelam, having moved across his stumps, plays all over it and gets pinned on the knee roll of the front pad. That was only heading one way, and that was into middle stump. No review from Achelam, and Uganda are eight down!
