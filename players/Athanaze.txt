<B>7.55pm</B> Sam Curran has the new ball, one slip in place. Play! <B>7.47pm</B> Still we wait. We're hearing suggestions it will be a target of <B>188 in 34 overs</B> but that's yet to be confirmed. In fact, there it is. We might yet be done before the sun rises in the UK... a restart at <B>7.55pm</B>. <B>7.30pm</B> Oh good grief, it's raining again. Brace for not a lot of news... looks pretty steady for the moment, so no prospect of a brisk restart. Stay tuned! Scratch that, the covers are coming off! What would I know...

Athanaze is OUT! lbw
lbw b Atkinson
Alick Athanaze lbw b Atkinson 45 (51b 7x4 0x6 59m) SR: 88.23
<b>pinned plumb in front!</b> Atkinson nails Athanaze on the shin with a 141kph/88mph full delivery and wins the decision from Leslie Riefer. Athanaze eventually reviews but the look on his face tells you plenty - and Hawk-Eye confirms it would have smashed into middle and off stumps halfway up. Second scalp for Atkinson, keeps England interested
Out strides the skipper, Shai Hope

Alick Athanaze. Had a terrific 2023. Facing Cummins in Australia might be a challenge to start off Thanks Gnasher! Hello everyone! How are we on this sunny Adelaide morning? Especially after Cummins double strike? And how are the West Indies fans feeling? Thought the openers did really well for most part of that first hour but unfortunately they couldn't come out unscathed.

Fuller and outside off, he feels for that and gets beaten. Another successful over for Pat

'Play says the ump' <strong>2:28pm</strong> Steven Smith and Co are relaxed, a few smiles as the players get into a huddle. Inglis stands a few feet back but is part of the team.

Josh Inglis stays a few feet apart from team-mates. Joy Murphy Wandin comes on to welcome the players. Nate Dousand sings the West Indies' cricket anthem - Rally Around the West Indies. Ben Clark sings Australia's anthem - Advance Australia Fair - along with a chorus behind. The smattering of crowd, mostly on the lower stands, applaud as the anthem finishes with a crescendo. Nice scenes. Thanks, Hemant. Bright day in Melbourne, stands yet to fill in. Mike Hussey says the MCG pitch has the second-most bounce of any Australian strip after the WACA. It has great pace and bounce. Says batters can expect the ball to come on beautifully. Once you get in, there'll be plenty of runs to be had. Ekanth is here to kick off the first innings.
