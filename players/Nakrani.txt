<strong>chopped on!</strong> Hard length just outside off. Comes back in with the angle and Nakrani, trying to dab it away, does not quite have the room he wants. Rolls off the higher part of the bat and bobbles into the stumps. Uganda four down now, and staring down the barrel!

<strong>classic left-arm spinner's dismissal!</strong> Floated up on a length outside off. Plenty of revs on this and the ball drops very late on Nakrani. He stretches out, trying to smother it but is nowhere close to the pitch of the ball. The ball grips in the surface too and bursts through the gap between bat and pad. Beautiful bowling!

<strong>taken brilliantly by Glenn Phillips!</strong> Dangles the carrot outside off and Nakrani bites. Looks for the big slog over cow corner but does not get the power, the placement or the elevation. Swipes it flat towards deep mid wicket, where Phillips hurtles in off the fence, lunges forward and snaffles up a sharp chance. Phillips was not right on the fence and that allowed him to get to it. Nakrani has to go, and Uganda are 26-7!
