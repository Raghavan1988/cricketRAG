It's Ervine and Kamunhukamwe to open for the visitors. Angelo Mathews with the ball first up, something he's been doing more of recently in T20s. <B>6:57pm</b> Alright the national anthems are done and the players are in the middle, so we're almost underway! Dillon N: "Fun fact, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe haven't played each other in this form of the game in over 11 years. The last time they met was in the ICC World T20 in 2012." Hansitha: "interesting call, Nuwan Thushara ahead of Dilshan Madhusanaka" --- To be fair, Thushara has been knocking on the door for quite some time with his LPL performances. Can he make the step up though? MadMax: "You said Ervine is not available but isn't he included for the team?" --- Apologies, think I may have been looking at an old squad list. It's been duly amended. Dulanjana : "Why Dilshan Madushanka is not there? Bring him for Shanaka, atleast for some reliable bowling option" --- Guessing he's being rested Dulanjana. Not the worst idea considering the way Sri Lanka's seam bowlers have been faring injury-wise in recent times. Navod Fernando : "I'm just asking, why do we need to keep Dasun Shanaka with Angelo Mathews? I know Shanaka is a power hitter, but he's not reliable. At the same time, Angelo Mathews can also do it. If not, at least some good power play bowling with Madushanka and Theekshana " --- Reasonable point Navod, but Shanaka hasn't done too badly in T20s as opposed to his very poor ODI form, so it makes sense to keep him in the side. Mathews inclusion is a little more left field for me, considering his powerhitting days seem in the distant past. Seems like the selectors want some experience for the World Cup. <B>Pitch report</b>: "New pitch," says Farveez Maharoof. "Less grass, but the hardness is still the same. This will see much more even bounce, and batters can play through the line.

He's also not too fussed to be batting first with the wicket looking a bit dry. Wanindu Hasaranga says there's two allrounders in the squad, Angelo Mathews and Dasun Shanaka, while Nuwan Thushara is also in the side. This means that there's no room Dhananjaya de Silva nor Dilshan Madushanka. <b>6:30pm</b> Time for the toss...and <b>Sri Lanka have won it and will bowl first!</b> For Zimbabwe, Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Tapiwa Mufudza and Faraz Akram make way from the ODIs, with allrounders Brian Bennett and Carl Mumba, and slow left arm spinner Ainsley Ndlovu coming in. Sikandar Raza will lead the side. Much though will depend on the Richard Ngarava, who caused Sri Lanka's top order all sorts of problems during the ODIs. <B>6.20pm</b> The toss is about 10 minutes away, so until then let's take a quick look at the squads. Both sides will have some new faces for the T20 portion of the series, though in Sri Lanka's case those new faces are in fact some rather old ones. Angelo Mathews will very likely make his T20I return today following an absence of three years, while Dhananjaya de Silva, the new Test skipper that was axed from the ODI squad, will be looking to show the selectors that he's still a viable option in white-ball cricket. Pathum Nissanka's return from a bout of dengue will boost the top order, while we might also see some game time for the slingy Nuwan Thushara fresh off his IPL contract. There's also Akila Dananjaya waiting in the wings, having last played a T20I in 2021. Big day then for Wanindu Hasaranga, who'll be captaining the national side for the first time today. And of course it is Sri Lanka that come into this game with the momentum on the back of a crushing win in the last ODI, and with it 2-0 a series win. Zimbabwe, despite having had their moments, have generally struggled to come to terms with Sri Lanka's bowling attack and that in general has proved the difference between these sides. The weather too has proven to be a menace, with each of the ODIs impacted by rain to varying degrees. The good news therefore today is that rain doesn't seem to be all that likely to play a part…so keep those fingers and toes crossed! <B>6.15pm</b> Evening folks, and welcome to our live coverage of the T20I series between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. This is Madushka and I'll be bringing you all the action today!

Navod: "There are too many test type players in the Sri Lankan lineup. That's makes me uncomfortable as we are going to chase." <b>Pitch report:</b> "Usually when you play four games on the same pitch you have lots of cracks, but in this I don't see any cracks that have widened," says Farveez Maharoof. "This pitch is very hard. In Colombo if you usually play four games in 12 days, you'd see some scar marks. But this looks fantastic. After a long time the Premadasa has a produced a pitch with lots of runs in it. 140-150 for me, I'm going a little lower from 170 because the last couple of days the sun was beating down on it. The dew factor should also be considered." Joe: "Would like Danajaya de S to open the innings , he seems to score better when he bats in the top 3 position , can experiment anyway as the other batters have failed consistently" Dan Weston: "Just like Sikandar Raza I found the hospitality of Sri Lankans to be remarkable!

Zimbabwe did well to target both Mathews and Shanaka, who with their gentle medium pace leave themselves with little to no margin for error. Is there a case to be made for including a fifth genuine bowler? You'd think with three allround options, in Mathews, Shanaka and Hasaranga, in the XI that would be a conversation worth having. Jongwe himself has had a tough time of it throughout the tour, with the Sri Lankan batters regularly targeting him for runs, but such match-turning efforts be it with bat or ball can do wondrous things in terms of overall confidence. Speaking after the game, both Jongwe and Raza also eluded to the fact that completing such a momentous chase had taken the proverbial monkey off their backs, so to speak. So does that mean we'll be seeing a more liberated Zimbabwe side today? So looking ahead to this game, well there's narratives aplenty. Angelo Mathews went from hero in game one, to an even more decorated hero at the halfway point in game two, before being suddenly and decisively brought crashing back to earth.

<B>The faintest of nicks sees the back of Kamunhukamwe!</b> Huge appeal for caught behind, but not given! Theekshana is certain though, and he immediately asks his skipper for a <b>review</b> This was a good length just outside off, Kamunhukamwe looks to cut it and yes Ultra Edge shows that this has just nicked the toe-end of the bat!
