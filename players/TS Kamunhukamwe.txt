Wanindu Hasaranga says there's two allrounders in the squad, Angelo Mathews and Dasun Shanaka, while Nuwan Thushara is also in the side. This means that there's no room Dhananjaya de Silva nor Dilshan Madushanka. <b>6:30pm</b> Time for the toss...and <b>Sri Lanka have won it and will bowl first!</b> For Zimbabwe, Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Tapiwa Mufudza and Faraz Akram make way from the ODIs, with allrounders Brian Bennett and Carl Mumba, and slow left arm spinner Ainsley Ndlovu coming in. Sikandar Raza will lead the side. Much though will depend on the Richard Ngarava, who caused Sri Lanka's top order all sorts of problems during the ODIs. <B>6.20pm</b> The toss is about 10 minutes away, so until then let's take a quick look at the squads. Both sides will have some new faces for the T20 portion of the series, though in Sri Lanka's case those new faces are in fact some rather old ones. Angelo Mathews will very likely make his T20I return today following an absence of three years, while Dhananjaya de Silva, the new Test skipper that was axed from the ODI squad, will be looking to show the selectors that he's still a viable option in white-ball cricket. Pathum Nissanka's return from a bout of dengue will boost the top order, while we might also see some game time for the slingy Nuwan Thushara fresh off his IPL contract. There's also Akila Dananjaya waiting in the wings, having last played a T20I in 2021. Big day then for Wanindu Hasaranga, who'll be captaining the national side for the first time today. And of course it is Sri Lanka that come into this game with the momentum on the back of a crushing win in the last ODI, and with it 2-0 a series win. Zimbabwe, despite having had their moments, have generally struggled to come to terms with Sri Lanka's bowling attack and that in general has proved the difference between these sides. The weather too has proven to be a menace, with each of the ODIs impacted by rain to varying degrees. The good news therefore today is that rain doesn't seem to be all that likely to play a part…so keep those fingers and toes crossed! <B>6.15pm</b> Evening folks, and welcome to our live coverage of the T20I series between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. This is Madushka and I'll be bringing you all the action today!

Joe: "Would like Danajaya de S to open the innings , he seems to score better when he bats in the top 3 position , can experiment anyway as the other batters have failed consistently" Dan Weston: "Just like Sikandar Raza I found the hospitality of Sri Lankans to be remarkable! A great place to visit." <B>6.45pm</b> While you wait for the start, a quick reminder that the Under-19 World Cup begins tomorrow. Here's Abhimanyu with the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/under-19-world-cup-2024-faqs-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-tournament-1416865">perfect primer to get you up to speed</a>. Full teams can be found <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/zimbabwe-in-sri-lanka-2023-24-1412536/sri-lanka-vs-zimbabwe-3rd-t20i-1412544/match-playing-xi">here</a>. <B>Sikandar Raza</b> says the win on Tuesday "was a long time coming". Adds that he wanted to bat first anyway, as he thinks it's a slow wicket with some turn. One change for them with Ryan Burl out for Tony Munyonga. He also has some praise for the hospitality his side have received: "I've thoroughly enjoyed Sri Lanka and its people. I'm very grateful for the love the team has received and we will cherish these memories." <B>Wanindu Hasaranga</b> says the potential for dew is the primary reason for bowling first. Big blow for Sri Lanka though as <B>Charith Asalanka has been ruled out</b> with an illness. Kamindu Mendis will come in for him. Kusal Perera is also left out with Dhananjaya de Silva included in his place. <B>6.28pm</b> Time then for the toss...<B>Sri Lanka have won it and will bowl first!</B> And where does this leave Sri Lanka? Twice their top order has had to be bailed out by the likes of Asalanka, Mathews and Shanaka; it's not a habit they want to have set in. There's also concerns about their fifth bowling option. Zimbabwe did well to target both Mathews and Shanaka, who with their gentle medium pace leave themselves with little to no margin for error. Is there a case to be made for including a fifth genuine bowler? You'd think with three allround options, in Mathews, Shanaka and Hasaranga, in the XI that would be a conversation worth having. Jongwe himself has had a tough time of it throughout the tour, with the Sri Lankan batters regularly targeting him for runs, but such match-turning efforts be it with bat or ball can do wondrous things in terms of overall confidence. Speaking after the game, both Jongwe and Raza also eluded to the fact that completing such a momentous chase had taken the proverbial monkey off their backs, so to speak. So does that mean we'll be seeing a more liberated Zimbabwe side today? So looking ahead to this game, well there's narratives aplenty. Angelo Mathews went from hero in game one, to an even more decorated hero at the halfway point in game two, before being suddenly and decisively brought crashing back to earth. And who better to do it than Luke Jongwe, the man for whom <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/zimbabwes-luke-jongwe-pastes-wallpaper-icon-angelo-mathews-sri-lanka-1416911">Mathews was a genuine idol</a> growing up, yup <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=570575189685122&set=a.105782222831090">Facebook profile picture</a> and all! <B>6:15pm</b> Hello and welcome to our coverage of this final encounter of the T20I series between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, and if the previous games are anything to go by this should be yet another cracker! This is Madushka Balasuriya and I'll be your eyes and ears for the next couple of hours.
