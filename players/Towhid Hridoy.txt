<b>And he's got another!</b> Or has he? Hridoy reviews. This though was a poor shot regardless. Charges down the track and has a wild heave across the line. He misses, and there is indeed a spike as the ball passes the edge. Bangladesh are three down and a review down to boot

Highest ODI score for Hridoy. He did not get his century, but has given Bangladesh more than a competitive score. Low full toss on the pads of Hridoy who gets across and flicks it miles over deep square leg
Must read alert: As we wait for the second innings to begin, here's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/why-sri-lanka-vs-bangladesh-is-like-large-men-fake-wrestling-each-other-in-too-tight-underpants-1424993">Fidel and Isam</a> on why Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh is like large men fake-wrestling each other in too-tight underpants. <b>6.05pm</b> Bangladesh started off in imperious manner through Soumya Sarkar, Sri Lanka then got back into the game in the middle overs courtesy of Wanindu Hasaranga. But Towhid Hridoy has ensured a whirlwind finish to take Bangladesh to 286. At one stage, Bangladesh were in danger of even reaching 260 but they hammered 44 runs off the last three overs to reach a more than competitive total of 286. Hridoy hit his highest ODI score of 96* while Sarkar hit 68. Taskin's 18* off 10 cameo was also useful. For Sri Lanka, Hasaranga picked up 4 for 45 off his ten overs. Madushka will be back for the chase in a bit AJ: "Considering that he's had to anchor the innings and defer from his usual style of batting, take a bow Hridoy. He's young and has played a mature knock. " CharithD: "Once again SL bowlers let the momentum down by not getting the tailenders out cheaply. Not only that they also allowed them to score freely. Lets see whether this would come back to bite them..." Aziz: "Starting to understand why people rate Hridoy so high"

Raza continues Sabuj Islam : "Hey, what is DLS per score now. Is Zim win based on current score." The Par score is 65 runs at 3 wickets down after 10 overs. The umpires are currently examining the area close to the pitch after removing the covers. Mamun: "@Sakib, why? I haven't seen much in Tanzid to consider him the next Tamim." Noman: "Bizarre approach from BD batters. Definitely Bangladesh isn't yet ready to be a T20 team. It is clearly understand by batting approach of BD batters that they will be happy to have 140-160 runs in 20 overs." This time, the rain has returned in force. The cheering crowds are fleeing from the galleries in an attempt to protect themselves from the rain.

Towhid Hridoy c Taylor b Ali Khan 58 (47b 4x4 2x6) SR: 123.4
Full-toss ball on the stumps, attempts to play across the line, finds the leading edge and skies it high to backward point, straightforward catch for Taylor
During the powerplay, Bangladesh struggled once more, losing wickets and failing to rotate the strike. Together, Hridoy and Mahmudullah formed an effective middle-order partnership that helped Bangladesh secure a respectable total. Today, Hridoy reached his second T20I fifty. The majority of Bangladesh's free hit deliveries ended in dots and singles, as the hitters were unable to capitalise on them. Steven Taylor performed excellent bowling, taking two wickets with just nine runs. Join us for the run chase after a short break. <strong>U.S.A requires 154 runs to win the match.</strong>

<strong>India have messed up a run-out chance!</strong> Length outside off. Hridoy pushes it to mid off and sets off for the single. His partner is not at all interested, though. Both are almost at the same end before Tanzid starts running. Dube's throw, though, is inaccurate and that lets Bangladesh off the hook

<strong>Axar has his first!</strong> Slowed up a little on a length just outside off. Hridoy's eyes light up and he goes down on one knee. Gets a decent chunk of it but not enough to clear the big deep mid wicket fence. Jadeja settles himself under it and snares the chance. Caps it off with an elongated trudge towards the rope, while being well in control of the ball!
