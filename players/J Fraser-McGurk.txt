Fraser-McGurk will take strike on ODI debut. Alzarri Joseph has the first new ball. Two slips. Deep third and fine leg back. <strong>2.28pm</strong> Inglis and Fraser-McGurk are about to walk out. The West Indies head onto the field. <strong>2.15pm</strong> For those who don't know anything about Jake Fraser-McGurk, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/who-is-new-world-record-holder-jake-fraser-mcgurk-1401715">here is some detail</a> from Gnasher after he set a world record in List A cricket earlier in the summer. <strong>2pm Toss</strong> West Indies win the toss and <strong>will bowl first</strong>. <strong>Shai Hope</strong>: "I don't think it's going to change too much. It has some grass on it so hopefully we can exploit that. We need to learn from the mistakes that we made in the first game and make amends. Alzarri and Ottley come in for Hodge and Walsh." <strong>Steve Smith</strong>: "I was probably going to bowl as well. We weren't sure what the surface is going to do. It's pretty dry and a few patches. Hopefully we can post a score. Two more debutants which is really exciting. Jake Fraser-McGurk had a really good BBL and Will Sutherland as well, he's worked very hard the last couple of years. Jake will open for Travis Head who is having a well-earned rest. Hazlewood only plays the home games. Just pops down the road for a game.
