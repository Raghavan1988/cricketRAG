Mohammad Nabi c Tector b van Woerkom 48 (62b 3x4 0x6 78m) SR: 77.41
<strong>Nabi holes out to long-on!</strong> He's not been getting as much strike in the last few overs. With the final powerplay underway, he tried going big. Got on one knee and tried lumping the full ball from outside off, with a rotational swing. Got it off the toe, Tector ran in, to the diagonal left, and took a good low catch.

Sri Lanka take a review for caught behind down leg! It's on a length on leg, Nabi looks to nudge it away but doesn't connect and Mendis pouches it behind the stumps. No bat on that, that clipped the pad. Oh no, no pad either and that review just gives Afghanistan an extra run! While it looked like it was brushing the pad, UltraEdge confirmed there was no sound!

<strong>Just wide of a diving midwicket fielder!</strong> Dug in short and Nabi goes for the pull. Avishka throws himself at it at full stretch but Nabi's placed it wide enough of him. No cover in the deep, so it goes away for four more as Nabi's innings picks up more steam

<strong>Madushan is Sri Lanka's star this innings!</strong> Outfoxes Nabi with a slower ball. Full and wide, legcutter. Nabi looks to swing it down the ground but ends up slicing it straight up in the air. Madushan claims it, settles under it and holds on with ease. A fantastic effort from Nabi comes to an end, a fantastic partnership comes to an end. And Madushan has his fourth!
