<strong>is there a nick?! South Africa think so but the umpire does not!</strong> Back of a length outside off. Seems to zip through off the surface and Nabi, without any foot movement, wafts at it. de Kock and Ngidi feel that Nabi has feathered this through to the keeper. The umpire is unmoved, and <strong>South Africa, unsurprisingly, go upstairs. And they are vindicated. There is a clear spike when the ball is next to the outside edge of the bat, and Afghanistan slider further!</strong>
