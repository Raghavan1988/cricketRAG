<strong>Loud, loud appeal and the umpire raises his finger!</strong> Was the angle taking the ball down leg though? I think it was, on first glance. Around the wicket, he gets the ball to shape back into Sheikh. He plays all around it and is caught in front. The question, though, stands if the angle would have taken the ball past the leg stump. Sheikh was down the track and was hit high on the thigh pad. I feel he is a little unlucky there.
