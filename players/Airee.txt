OUT! {"short": "caught", "long": "c \u2020de Kock b Shamsi", "commentary": "Dipendra Singh Airee c \u2020de Kock b Shamsi 6 (11b 0x4 0x6 15m) SR: 54.54"}
<strong>Late twist?!</strong> Shamsi gets a wicket with a ball fired down leg! Airee looks to sweep but misses. QDK grabs it and goes up in appeal. The umpire thinks so too and Nepal review immediately. There's a spike as the ball passes the glove and Airee will have to go!
