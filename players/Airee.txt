<strong>That's that! Nepal win by six wickets and 42 balls to spare.</strong> A proper thumping. Airee it is who gets the winning runs. Right in the slot on middle stump. He waits for it and smashes it straight down the ground. All smiles in the Nepal camp and they get on the board with two points.
Nepal collect two points while USA have a lot of thinking to do. In case you missed the action, PDP has you covered with his report. That will be it from us today but we will be back tomorrow nice and early for the two games. Till then, this is Ashish Pant, signing off on behalf of Peter Della Penna and K Vairavan. Ciao! Kalpit Dhakal: "Dipendra Singh Airee back in form, major positive of this match." <b>Rohit Paudel</b>, Nepal captain: Happy with the performance of teh team. We were looking for a win and we got it. He [Karan KC] was brilliant. He used the conditions really well. He and Lalit bowled very well and that set the tone for us. His [Rajbanshi's] contribution is main, and that helped Karan. [Batting] Bhim batted really well, and Deepi <i>da</i> also batted well. We hope to not make the same mistakes again. [West Indies match] We all are looking forward to the match. We want everyone to contribute in that game, and we have to play our best cricket. <b>Aaron Jones</b>, USA captain: [The target] It was enough, but we did not bowl well. The wicket started playing better in the second innings. It was a bit tough at the top but Shayan played a good innings. Very happy for him. We have lost the first two games, but we are positive we can win and qualify for the World Cup. <b>Karan KC is the Player of the Match</b>: It was just the plan. If we won the toss, we had to bowl and I got the basics right. I really enjoyed the opening spell. The ball was doing enough, and it was my ideal length. Very important win, we have two games and we have to win at least one of the games and qualify for the top six. The batters played really well. Sharki enjoyed his batting, and we were also enjoying from the outside. <b>Presentation time</b> <strong>4.21pm</strong> A performance right out of the top drawer from Nepal. It was Karan KC who set the tone with the ball a four-wicket haul up top and Ben Sharki setup the chase, scoring an unbeaten 114-ball 77. That USA got to 207 was all down to Shayan Jahangir's maiden ODI century. However, the target was always expected to be within  Nepal's grasp. They need a good start, which was provided by Kushal Burtel and Sharki who added 49 runs for the second wicket. Paudel and Sharki then pitched in important contributions before USA got back with a couple of wickets. However, Dipendra Singh Airee was quick off the blocks and that rubbed on Sharki, who begann playing his shots. The duo added 74 runs off 64 and took Nepal to an easy win in the end.

<strong>Late twist?!</strong> Shamsi gets a wicket with a ball fired down leg! Airee looks to sweep but misses. QDK grabs it and goes up in appeal. The umpire thinks so too and Nepal review immediately. There's a spike as the ball passes the glove and Airee will have to go!
