About to start though Looks like Shaheen will bowl the first over. <strong>Virat and Rohit</strong> walking out to bat. Meanwhile, as we wait, if you want to hear inspirational stories from other sports, how about this one? Nine months ago, Vinesh Phogat could not even walk. Today, after a gruelling recovery, she is four bouts at the Paris Olympics away from becoming <a href="https://www.espn.in/wrestling/story/_/id/40289008/vinesh-phogat-path-paris-olympics-indian-wrestling-quota-winner-career" target="_blank">India's greatest-ever wrestler</a>, both on and off the mat. The teams are walking out for the anthems under somewhat overcast skies. Ahad: "Danyal, my favourite thing about your commentary is the unveiled disdain towards people writing in. Please never change" It's my favourite thing about doing comms, though I still enjoy people writing in. So keep at it, folks! Shadow-Shell: "Is it the usual 1 hour extra time for rain delay to complete a full match or is it different for World Cups" There's an extra 90 minutes beyond the usual cut-off times for this game. So they'll try and get a full 40 overs in. There is, just to be clear, <strong>no reserve day</strong> BalaBlazer: "Can they allow impact players just for this game? @yuvi and @shahidafridi can join the clash which will make it even more interesting. " Could not imagine a less interesting thing to do Anant: "Looking forward to the creativity of the ICC in terms of scheduling a reserve game" It's stopped raining, and the <strong>umpires are coming out for an inspection</strong>.

Considering their bowling line up and their never ending habit of ever giving up after loosing to a minnows in a tournament - They are all set to start their tournament with a win over arch rivals!" A lot of you seem to reckon that was a colossal toss to win. <b>India:</b> Rohit Sharma (capt), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammad Siraj <b>Pakistan:</b> Babar Azam (capt), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir "We've played a few games here, we've tried to assess the conditions as much as possible," Rohit says. "Every game is important. Anything can happen, this is a very funny tournament." <strong>India are unchanged </strong> <strong>Pakistan have won the toss and will field first</strong> "The past is the past, and we're looking forward to this match," says Babar Azam <strong>Imad Wasim in for Azam Khan</strong> the only Pakistan change <b>10.23am</b> Fairly even square boundaries today: 66m on one side and 70m on the other. The wind speed right now is 23kph - not sure what direction it's blowing in. A network of cracks and large plates all over the pitch, with a good amount of grass cover too. Don't expect big totals today.

It means history, added interest (for example, Real Madrid vs Barcelona has morbo). There are 2 cricket match ups which, to my mind, have morbo. One is England vs Australia which we had yesterday. The other, particularly because it's only played at world cups, is India vs Pakistan. A weekend of treats!" <b>10.14am</b> The inspection is on as we speak. The covers are coming off the square. <b>10.07am</b> Chris Gayle is in New York. Wearing a white jacket that the India players autograph. Just spotted Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar too.

About to start though Looks like Shaheen will bowl the first over. <strong>Virat and Rohit</strong> walking out to bat. Meanwhile, as we wait, if you want to hear inspirational stories from other sports, how about this one? Nine months ago, Vinesh Phogat could not even walk. Today, after a gruelling recovery, she is four bouts at the Paris Olympics away from becoming <a href="https://www.espn.in/wrestling/story/_/id/40289008/vinesh-phogat-path-paris-olympics-indian-wrestling-quota-winner-career" target="_blank">India's greatest-ever wrestler</a>, both on and off the mat. The teams are walking out for the anthems under somewhat overcast skies. Ahad: "Danyal, my favourite thing about your commentary is the unveiled disdain towards people writing in.

Shadow-Shell: "Is it the usual 1 hour extra time for rain delay to complete a full match or is it different for World Cups" There's an extra 90 minutes beyond the usual cut-off times for this game.

He expects the ball to come onto the bat throughout the game. 180-190 could be a par score and he reckons batting or bowling first will not matter much. Even-sized boundaries, and no bias to one particular square boundary. <strong>9:50am</strong> Najmul Hossain Shanto has seen a lot of highs and lows already in his career. Now, he has the responsibility of leading Bangladesh at the T20 World Cup and making sure they go deep into the tournament. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/can-najmul-hossain-shanto-pilot-a-successful-world-cup-campaign-for-bangladesh-1434640">This piece by Mohammad Isam then is just what you'd want to read. </a> <strong>9:45am</strong> For those asking, Virat Kohli is at the ground and did hop down with a pair of gloves and his bat, presumably for a session of knocking. He did <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-india-virat-kohli-joins-team-ahead-of-warm-up-vs-bangladesh-1435972">join up with the squad late</a> and it remains to be seen if he will feature today. Saifi: "I really feel India have more headaches to take care of than BD, but those are good ones to have. Since this platform allows us to to send our opinion, I'll begin by saying Virat should open the innings along with Jaiswal or Rohit. If Rohit bats over or under the SKY, it'll eventually benefit team India and so will Virat's new role!" -- India do have a few tough calls to make on the batting front, and this piece by Sidharth Monga <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/t20-world-cup-2024-india-virat-kohli-rohit-sharma-batting-position-1435967">sheds light on the options they possibly have to choose from. </a> <b>9:30am</b> Lots of work has gone into getting this stadium in Nassau County ready for T20 World Cup action. Dive straight into this piece to know <a href="https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1435720/new-york-s-beautiful-monster--how-a-cricket-venue-was-created-from-scratch">how the stadium was built from scratch, despite being in a race against time.</a> Our man Sidharth Monga has made his way to the venue in Nassau County and this is what he has to say: "It's a lovely pleasant morning. Temperature 18 degrees right now, highs of 29 expected at 4pm. The press box TV is showing AKC Fastest Dogs USA. I see Ginny running right now, followed by Coco. They seem to be having the time of their lives". He also adds that there are about 50 or so fans at the venue at the moment, and that Bangladesh began their warm-up routines at around 9:15am local time, with India setting up soon after. <b>9:20am</b> The track to global T20I domination has been laid out. The twists, turns, chicanes and hair-pin bends have been mapped. The engines are revving but just before the lights go out, there is one last pit stop to make… Bangladesh, you could argue, need this fixture more than India. There are several questions to answer in the aftermath of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/usa-vs-bangladesh-2024-1425119">2-1 series defeat to the USA</a>, and while a resolution might not be immediate or straightforward, a good performance here will give them confidence of ultimately acquiring those answers. India and their players, on the other hand, have been fed a T20-rich diet since the end of March. The IPL only wound down last Sunday and familiarity with the format should not be an issue. The challenge will be to pack everything together and brew up a concoction that is not just delectable in the moment, but also retains its freshness throughout. So, here we are. The final dress rehearsal before this region gets properly stuck into the whirlwind that the T20 World Cup is. The real thing does not arrive at this venue until Monday, but today should offer some clarity on what could be in store, and on how this country, soaked in sporting tradition, will embrace this hugely popular sport. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of this <b>T20 World Cup</b> warm-up game between <b>Bangladesh</b>, longing to get a win under their belt, and <b>India</b>, hoping to begin their North American adventure on the right note. Hop on, this should be fun!
