Big appeal for lbw. Rohit is rooted to the crease as this one hits length on off and nips back in to strike the pad. Not given on field by Ahsan Raza. South Africa instinctively review. Height in question. And ball tracking confirms this would've missed the stumps. <b> South Africa burn a review </b> Jansen's release point and height may have saved Rohit there.

Big appeal for lbw. Rohit is rooted to the crease as this one hits length on off and nips back in to strike the pad. Not given on field by Ahsan Raza. South Africa instinctively review. Height in question. And ball tracking confirms this would've missed the stumps. <b> South Africa burn a review </b> Jansen's release point and height may have saved Rohit there.

Did that hit Rohit in the grill? Yes, seems like it. Physio is running out. Bumper angling in over off, 143ks. Rohit was hopping, the bat was next to his chest and he realised he couldn't play it. So, he turned his face the other way, the ball sped in and hit him on the grill, right in the middle in face. Thank goodness for helmets.

Wow, the host broadcaster has just shown some replays of the ball at 46.3 and <strong>England might have missed out on a wicket</strong>... looks as though it may have struck Rohit on the forearm, <i>just</i> above the strap of the glove, and Hawk-Eye's projection has three reds with the ball crashing into the top of leg stump! Would have been a tricky decision for the TV umpire if England had reviewed as there was a gentle murmur on UltraEdge... did it brush the glove?

Thanks for all your entries!</i> <b>11.44am</b> The covers are coming off. The Pakistan players are getting warmed up. Nishit Rao: "Rain rain go away India Pak want to play If you continue to stay Virat Kohli cannot slay Much to yours and my dismay To India Pak I want to say While there's sunshine make some hay" -- On the subject of poetry, the stadium DJ, as we speak, is churning out one of the greatest bits of verse ever written, the bit that rhymes "amplifier" and "fire". <b>11.40am</b> The umpires are out, with their umbrellas, but the umbrellas are folded. These are the cutting-edge observations you log into ESPNcricinfo for. Rod Tucker and Richard Illingworth just had a quick look at their watches too, FWIW. Prashant: "@Karthik - not sure which broadcast you are watching. But mine showed a replay which indicated an inside edge." -- Must have missed it! <b>11.34am</b> By our calculations, we'll start losing overs at 12.04pm. Looks like the drizzle has reduced significantly, though I'm not sure whether it's stopped. Baitullah: "Just curious about the last ball of the over. Just want to know if Rohit nicked that or it was hitting the pad first. Couldn't watch on TV." -- It looked like an inside edge, and Babar seemed to indicate this to Shaheen too. Still no close-ups or UltraEdge on the broadcast. <b>11.27am</b> Thanks, Danyal. At least the crowd at the stadium is getting to listen to some bangers. Junoon's 'Sayyonee' is playing as we speak.

Hari: "What does Virat do now? Had reinvented his T20 game and now finds himself in a position where there is a very appealing argument of him switching back to his old game..." Arjit: "After seeing that the outfield has become super slow, Rohit has decided to either go aerial or block, no running" <b>11.24am</b> Slight drizzle starts again, and <strong>the players are heading off once more</strong>. Solid start from India, but this stop-start nature will not help the batters. Hopefully we should get play soon, and meanwhile, Karthik comes in to keep you company

Meanwhile, as we wait, if you want to hear inspirational stories from other sports, how about this one? Nine months ago, Vinesh Phogat could not even walk. Today, after a gruelling recovery, she is four bouts at the Paris Olympics away from becoming <a href="https://www.espn.in/wrestling/story/_/id/40289008/vinesh-phogat-path-paris-olympics-indian-wrestling-quota-winner-career" target="_blank">India's greatest-ever wrestler</a>, both on and off the mat. The teams are walking out for the anthems under somewhat overcast skies. Ahad: "Danyal, my favourite thing about your commentary is the unveiled disdain towards people writing in. Please never change" It's my favourite thing about doing comms, though I still enjoy people writing in. So keep at it, folks! Shadow-Shell: "Is it the usual 1 hour extra time for rain delay to complete a full match or is it different for World Cups" There's an extra 90 minutes beyond the usual cut-off times for this game. So they'll try and get a full 40 overs in. There is, just to be clear, <strong>no reserve day</strong> BalaBlazer: "Can they allow impact players just for this game? @yuvi and @shahidafridi can join the clash which will make it even more interesting. " Could not imagine a less interesting thing to do Anant: "Looking forward to the creativity of the ICC in terms of scheduling a reserve game" It's stopped raining, and the <strong>umpires are coming out for an inspection</strong>. We will now start at <strong>11.20am local time</strong> <strong>Absolutely pouring now, and the start has been delayed</strong> <b>10.41am:</b> It's <strong>raining once more</strong> Prashant Vats: "A big toss win for Pakistan. Considering their bowling line up and their never ending habit of ever giving up after loosing to a minnows in a tournament - They are all set to start their tournament with a win over arch rivals!" A lot of you seem to reckon that was a colossal toss to win. <b>India:</b> Rohit Sharma (capt), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammad Siraj <b>Pakistan:</b> Babar Azam (capt), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir "We've played a few games here, we've tried to assess the conditions as much as possible," Rohit says. "Every game is important. Anything can happen, this is a very funny tournament." <strong>India are unchanged </strong> <strong>Pakistan have won the toss and will field first</strong> "The past is the past, and we're looking forward to this match," says Babar Azam <strong>Imad Wasim in for Azam Khan</strong> the only Pakistan change <b>10.23am</b> Fairly even square boundaries today: 66m on one side and 70m on the other.

It means history, added interest (for example, Real Madrid vs Barcelona has morbo). There are 2 cricket match ups which, to my mind, have morbo. One is England vs Australia which we had yesterday. The other, particularly because it's only played at world cups, is India vs Pakistan. A weekend of treats!" <b>10.14am</b> The inspection is on as we speak. The covers are coming off the square. <b>10.07am</b> Chris Gayle is in New York. Wearing a white jacket that the India players autograph. Just spotted Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar too. Aftab: "Chris Gayle's jacket has Indian colors on right arm and Pakistani colors on left, in case you missed. True legend. This jacket deserves a place in Cricket museum." <b>10.03am</b> There's an inspection at <strong>10.15am local time</strong> Taz: "I live 10 minutes away from the stadium and I can hear the noise from my porch even though the match hasn't started yet. Insane!!" Nikhil : "Cricket world cup, rivalry game, tricky pitch and rain delay, this game has to be a psychological nightmare for the players." Shabbir: "What're the chances of Saim Ayub playing together? He was terrific in the CPL last year but hasn't fired in T20Is yet" Pak have kept team news close to their chest. I suspect he'll miss out today, though Alosh K Jose: "Got to say, the weather in Paris is perfect for cricket... " They had their fair share of rain in the first week, to be fair ashish: "@Danyal - you mentioned with some luck the rain might miss the stadium.

Thanks for all your entries!</i> <b>11.44am</b> The covers are coming off. The Pakistan players are getting warmed up. Nishit Rao: "Rain rain go away India Pak want to play If you continue to stay Virat Kohli cannot slay Much to yours and my dismay To India Pak I want to say While there's sunshine make some hay" -- On the subject of poetry, the stadium DJ, as we speak, is churning out one of the greatest bits of verse ever written, the bit that rhymes "amplifier" and "fire". <b>11.40am</b> The umpires are out, with their umbrellas, but the umbrellas are folded. These are the cutting-edge observations you log into ESPNcricinfo for. Rod Tucker and Richard Illingworth just had a quick look at their watches too, FWIW. Prashant: "@Karthik - not sure which broadcast you are watching. But mine showed a replay which indicated an inside edge." -- Must have missed it! <b>11.34am</b> By our calculations, we'll start losing overs at 12.04pm. Looks like the drizzle has reduced significantly, though I'm not sure whether it's stopped. Baitullah: "Just curious about the last ball of the over. Just want to know if Rohit nicked that or it was hitting the pad first. Couldn't watch on TV." -- It looked like an inside edge, and Babar seemed to indicate this to Shaheen too. Still no close-ups or UltraEdge on the broadcast. <b>11.27am</b> Thanks, Danyal. At least the crowd at the stadium is getting to listen to some bangers. Junoon's 'Sayyonee' is playing as we speak. Veer: "Per local radar imagery from the nearby national weather service office in Upton, looks like a fairly heavy shower but not too much behind it. Hopefully should get started back again soon!" Hari: "What does Virat do now? Had reinvented his T20 game and now finds himself in a position where there is a very appealing argument of him switching back to his old game..." Arjit: "After seeing that the outfield has become super slow, Rohit has decided to either go aerial or block, no running" <b>11.24am</b> Slight drizzle starts again, and <strong>the players are heading off once more</strong>.

We're fiddling around with the sightscreen, as we always seem to. About to start though Looks like Shaheen will bowl the first over. <strong>Virat and Rohit</strong> walking out to bat. Meanwhile, as we wait, if you want to hear inspirational stories from other sports, how about this one? Nine months ago, Vinesh Phogat could not even walk. Today, after a gruelling recovery, she is four bouts at the Paris Olympics away from becoming <a href="https://www.espn.in/wrestling/story/_/id/40289008/vinesh-phogat-path-paris-olympics-indian-wrestling-quota-winner-career" target="_blank">India's greatest-ever wrestler</a>, both on and off the mat. The teams are walking out for the anthems under somewhat overcast skies. Ahad: "Danyal, my favourite thing about your commentary is the unveiled disdain towards people writing in. Please never change" It's my favourite thing about doing comms, though I still enjoy people writing in. So keep at it, folks! Shadow-Shell: "Is it the usual 1 hour extra time for rain delay to complete a full match or is it different for World Cups" There's an extra 90 minutes beyond the usual cut-off times for this game. So they'll try and get a full 40 overs in. There is, just to be clear, <strong>no reserve day</strong> BalaBlazer: "Can they allow impact players just for this game? @yuvi and @shahidafridi can join the clash which will make it even more interesting. " Could not imagine a less interesting thing to do Anant: "Looking forward to the creativity of the ICC in terms of scheduling a reserve game" It's stopped raining, and the <strong>umpires are coming out for an inspection</strong>. We will now start at <strong>11.20am local time</strong> <strong>Absolutely pouring now, and the start has been delayed</strong> <b>10.41am:</b> It's <strong>raining once more</strong> Prashant Vats: "A big toss win for Pakistan. Considering their bowling line up and their never ending habit of ever giving up after loosing to a minnows in a tournament - They are all set to start their tournament with a win over arch rivals!" A lot of you seem to reckon that was a colossal toss to win. <b>India:</b> Rohit Sharma (capt), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammad Siraj <b>Pakistan:</b> Babar Azam (capt), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir "We've played a few games here, we've tried to assess the conditions as much as possible," Rohit says. "Every game is important. Anything can happen, this is a very funny tournament." <strong>India are unchanged </strong> <strong>Pakistan have won the toss and will field first</strong> "The past is the past, and we're looking forward to this match," says Babar Azam <strong>Imad Wasim in for Azam Khan</strong> the only Pakistan change <b>10.23am</b> Fairly even square boundaries today: 66m on one side and 70m on the other. The wind speed right now is 23kph - not sure what direction it's blowing in. A network of cracks and large plates all over the pitch, with a good amount of grass cover too. Don't expect big totals today.

It means history, added interest (for example, Real Madrid vs Barcelona has morbo). There are 2 cricket match ups which, to my mind, have morbo. One is England vs Australia which we had yesterday. The other, particularly because it's only played at world cups, is India vs Pakistan. A weekend of treats!" <b>10.14am</b> The inspection is on as we speak. The covers are coming off the square. <b>10.07am</b> Chris Gayle is in New York. Wearing a white jacket that the India players autograph. Just spotted Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar too. Aftab: "Chris Gayle's jacket has Indian colors on right arm and Pakistani colors on left, in case you missed. True legend. This jacket deserves a place in Cricket museum." <b>10.03am</b> There's an inspection at <strong>10.15am local time</strong> Taz: "I live 10 minutes away from the stadium and I can hear the noise from my porch even though the match hasn't started yet. Insane!!" Nikhil : "Cricket world cup, rivalry game, tricky pitch and rain delay, this game has to be a psychological nightmare for the players." Shabbir: "What're the chances of Saim Ayub playing together? He was terrific in the CPL last year but hasn't fired in T20Is yet" Pak have kept team news close to their chest. I suspect he'll miss out today, though Alosh K Jose: "Got to say, the weather in Paris is perfect for cricket... " They had their fair share of rain in the first week, to be fair ashish: "@Danyal - you mentioned with some luck the rain might miss the stadium.

there's that pick-up shot again, but this time he's picked out the fielder at deep square leg! I think Rohit has been done in again by the lack of swing. It was quite full, quite straight, but I would think Rohit was aiming to hit behind square, but it ends up coming off the face of his bat a little awkwardly, and goes to the man on the boundary, who moves a few yards to his left to take it.
