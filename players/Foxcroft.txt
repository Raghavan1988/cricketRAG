Prolonged appeal for lbw, umpire says not out for thinking for a while. Tossed up beautifully fuller on leg, he was outside his crease, plenty of doubt

Perilously close to chopping it back onto the stump, went too far away from leg-stump and went for the cut, inside edge rolls over towards fine leg, Imad brought the pace to a grinding halt and tested his patience, that drifted back sharply as well

Belted back to Imad who can't cling on, there was barely any time to react and it looks like he has injured his thumb in the process, that was looped up from round the wicket on a length at middle, he gave him a charge and went full-blooded through the line, Imad is getting some medical attention from the physio

Sashayed across his stumps, down on one knee and slog swept straight towards the fielder at deep square's left, Abbas looks like the fielder patrolling that region, time for a strategic break, crucial passage of play coming up
Faraz bin Shafi: "Will never understand Usama Amir's repeated inclusion in the squad. This is the phase where Pakistan should be looking to build their team for the World Cup, and Usama Mir has yet to perform in any meaningful international match." Sher Baz Ali: "Babar as a batsman is out of this world! But as a captain, he is very defensive and only goes with the script, you have to think out of the box to get the opposition under pressure, he is so predictable and the opposition feels no difficulty understanding his plans. When was the last time we saw Babar bowling 3 overs upfront with a pacer or a spinner? He is continuously following the script, two overs from this bowler, two from that bowler, not a good captaincy. Poor decisions"

Another one bites the dust! That hung in the air for a while and was <strong>snaffled </strong>while the fielder was moving to his left. Floated up shorter on off, got plenty of bounce, tries to get underneath and looked to big over deep midwicket, more elevation than distance, Fakhar is safe as a house in the outfield. Foxcroft loses the plot as he tried to accelerate, the wicket will stymie the run-flow
