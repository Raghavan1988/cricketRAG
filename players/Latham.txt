He had a 1st class bowling average of 37.58 coming into his debut, I don't get it" -- I'd keep the overall first-class numbers aside but focus on his recent performances for South Africa A and in domestic first-class.

A function was held last night to mark the anniversary and Alex was there: "Last night the Canterbury Cricket Trust hosted an event here at Hagley Oval celebrating the 50th anniversary of New Zealand's first Test win over Australia at Lancaster Park in 1974. Six of the 12 from that team attended including Glenn Turner, Jeremy Coney, Sir Richard Hadlee, Dayle Hadlee, Richard Collinge and Barry Hadlee [12th man]. They held a Q and A. Some wonderful stories were shared by the team. The most amusing moment of the night came when veteran Australian radio broadcaster Jim Maxwell, who attended as a guest, revealed to the panel that he was texting with Australia's 1974 captain Ian Chappell during the event and had relayed that there had been several jokes made at Chappell and the Australians' expense. Chappell's response via Jim was 'ask them what happened in the next Test at Eden Park'." <b>10.33am</b> <B>Australia win the toss and bowl</b>. "Looks pretty good but a touch of green there," Pat Cummins says. "Hopefully a few more contributors this week." Tim Southee: "We've seen in the past sides that bat first are more than capable of putting a big score on the board. The longevity, awesome to be able to do it alongside Kane. A job to focus on over the next five days." <b>New Zealand</b> 1 Tom Latham, 2 Will Young, 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Rachin Ravindra, 5 Daryl Mitchell, 6 Tom Blundell (wk), 7 Glenn Phillips, 8 Scott Kuggeleijn, 9 Matt Henry, 10 Tim Southee (capt), 11 Ben Sears <b>Australia</b> 1 Usman Khawaja, 2 Steven Smith, 3 Marnus Labuschagne, 4 Cameron Green, 5 Travis Head, 6 Mitchell Marsh, 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Pat Cummins (capt), 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Josh Hazlewood <b>10.15am</b> Speaking of Alex, here he is again. "Hello from Hagley Oval. It is a very pleasant day. The sun is out but it's quite cool. The temperature is not going to reach 20 degrees. The Australians have their jumpers on in the warm-up. Two Queenslanders have beanies on but it is not that cold. Lovely crowd building on the banks. The pitch looks good. There is solid grass cover but it does not look anywhere near as green as the Basin. The groundstaff did a lot of rolling in the last two days and it was warm yesterday. The winner of the toss could very well bat first. New Zealand look like they will play four quicks with Scott Kuggeleijn set to retain his place.

Mitchell Starc, as expected, has ball in hand. Three slips and a gully in <strong>10:59am</strong> Morning all, the anthems are done. Williamson and Southee were out with their daughters for it. Marais Erasmus got a guard of honour from the Australia players as this is his last Test. Packed house, sunshine out but the conditions are cold. Richard Hadlee rings the bell to kick things off. <strong>If you're in the US, you can watch this game <a href="https://www.espn.com/espnplus/player/_/id/0bb4cd5c-785c-4fe4-a88a-13cc78c43365">LIVE on ESPN+</a></strong> As we wait for the action, you can catch up on the the latest episode of ESPN's <i>Around The Wicket</i> where Neroli Meadows is joined by new guests Simon Katich and Tim Paine while Ross Taylor is back on the show. <b>10.45am</b> Fifteen minutes until the action when we'll see what Australia's new-ball attack can do on this surface. I'll hand over to Ekanth. <b>10.40am</b> Kevin: "Toss was huge here and I think for Ne Zealand and our best chance was to bowl first and look to knock Australia over in a couple of sessions. Hopefully the top order can pull through, but this is going to be very tough!"

A function was held last night to mark the anniversary and Alex was there: "Last night the Canterbury Cricket Trust hosted an event here at Hagley Oval celebrating the 50th anniversary of New Zealand's first Test win over Australia at Lancaster Park in 1974. Six of the 12 from that team attended including Glenn Turner, Jeremy Coney, Sir Richard Hadlee, Dayle Hadlee, Richard Collinge and Barry Hadlee [12th man]. They held a Q and A. Some wonderful stories were shared by the team. The most amusing moment of the night came when veteran Australian radio broadcaster Jim Maxwell, who attended as a guest, revealed to the panel that he was texting with Australia's 1974 captain Ian Chappell during the event and had relayed that there had been several jokes made at Chappell and the Australians' expense. Chappell's response via Jim was 'ask them what happened in the next Test at Eden Park'." <b>10.33am</b> <B>Australia win the toss and bowl</b>. "Looks pretty good but a touch of green there," Pat Cummins says. "Hopefully a few more contributors this week." Tim Southee: "We've seen in the past sides that bat first are more than capable of putting a big score on the board. The longevity, awesome to be able to do it alongside Kane. A job to focus on over the next five days." <b>New Zealand</b> 1 Tom Latham, 2 Will Young, 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Rachin Ravindra, 5 Daryl Mitchell, 6 Tom Blundell (wk), 7 Glenn Phillips, 8 Scott Kuggeleijn, 9 Matt Henry, 10 Tim Southee (capt), 11 Ben Sears <b>Australia</b> 1 Usman Khawaja, 2 Steven Smith, 3 Marnus Labuschagne, 4 Cameron Green, 5 Travis Head, 6 Mitchell Marsh, 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Pat Cummins (capt), 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Josh Hazlewood <b>10.15am</b> Speaking of Alex, here he is again. "Hello from Hagley Oval. It is a very pleasant day. The sun is out but it's quite cool. The temperature is not going to reach 20 degrees. The Australians have their jumpers on in the warm-up. Two Queenslanders have beanies on but it is not that cold. Lovely crowd building on the banks. The pitch looks good. There is solid grass cover but it does not look anywhere near as green as the Basin. The groundstaff did a lot of rolling in the last two days and it was warm yesterday. The winner of the toss could very well bat first. New Zealand look like they will play four quicks with Scott Kuggeleijn set to retain his place.

Well well, spin in the first hour. Whodda thunk that after Australia chose to bowl. Lyon, from around the wicket. Don't think it's a far cry but probably not their plan A.

Latham proactive right up, goes across and paddles it fine. The line was fullish and the bounce not big, which meant it was a safe shot.

Drinks. Interesting first hour. NZ will be happy. Young's been scratchy at times but stuck through. Latham more confident but probably got more bad balls. Gnasher will be back, maybe give Australia's perspective of how things have gone so far.

Fullish ball angling in towards off. Latham tries working it across, gets an inside edge onto the back leg. Just above the pads and into the ground. That got a bit of extra bounce
Mukunda: "Gilchrist said couple of times in his commentary during AUSvsWI that 3 maidens in row will fetch a wicket in the following 4th over. But contrary to that in this match  after three maidens (overs 7,8,9) in the 10th over NZ started piling runs again." Think Warne was a fan of that theory too. That and 'if it seams, it spins'

Three-quarter length through top of fourth stump. Shaped back in but swung sharply after passing the stumps. Again. Carey does well again, by leaping low to the right and taking it. Was left alone of course.
