<b>a celebrappeal from Paterson</b> but given not out. South Africa want to review it. A length ball that came in with the angle to beat the inside edge and hit Latham around, perhaps just above, the knee roll. He was looking to flick it away but his head fell over. The ball-tracking shows it would have gone over. South Africa lose a review

<B>off stump knocked back!</b> Full ball on off. But Latham opts to play off the back foot instead of coming forward. Tries to block, and the ball turns past his outside edge and hits the pole. Piedt enjoyed that!
Ramapriya: "Is von Berg looking anywhere near Test class?" -- legspin in Test cricket, especially in these conditions, are quite rare. So savouring it irrespective.
