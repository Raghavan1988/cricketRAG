<strong>De Leede taken aback by the extra bounce there</strong>. It reared up from a slight back of length and all de Leede could do was hang his bat in front, bottom hand came off. Ball lobbed up but landed safely on the infield. No one at midwicket and bowler had too much to do

Shot: ON_DRIVE
run scored: 2
This is like attacking Test batting. Mid-on was close and a bit wide, so when de Leede saw this pitched up, he punched the ball firmly. Went with the full face but doesn't middle it
Bhargav : "Isn't this SA line up Scarily Strong ?" Um, yeah...

Bumper around the helmet, de Leede goes for the swivel-hook. Doesn't connect

<strong>Beaten on the inside edge this time</strong>. Length ball just outside off, de Leede shaped to cut but noticed there was too little room and tried bunting. Couldn't adjust in time

Shot: DEFENDED

Is the pitch starting to play more tricks? This might've held up a bit, de Leede was early into the push towards cover. Had to check the shot and spooned the fullish ball a bit. It landed safely though

Full on off, driven to long-off. 84ks
Rajbis: "I have a different view. SA made a little mistake here opting to bowl first. Of course, they didn't underestimate NED. However, had they chosen batting, their batters could play whole 20 overs. Restricting NED to low total, they won't utilize all overs (warm up or dusting off of the batsmen). " They've done really well so far though

<b>Whoa, this one's exploded off a back of length and de Leede can only balloon it to point</b>. De Leede made room but got followed. He jumped and got his bottom hand off, the ball went up off the shoulder of the bat and the fielder leapt across to take it. SA celebrate, Nortje might have another good day
