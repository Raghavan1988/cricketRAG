Clears the front leg but, Motie too, has to reach out, and wait as well as Ngidi (from around) went shortish and wide. Cuts it off the bottom of the stick towards cover

full ball clubbed to cow corner and they call for two. They get there and <B>West Indies finish on 207 for 7</b>
<B>3.36pm</b> A sensational 38-ball 67 from Chase lifts WI to 207. But he was starved of strike in the 20th over, so SA have escaped from conceding more in the back end. King, Mayers, Fletcher and Shepherd were all impressive too.<BR><BR>As for South Africa, debutant legspinner Peter impressed with 2 for 32. Fortuin was miserly with 1-21. Phehlukwayo conceded a bowling half-century while Ngidi bowled the tough overs. Himanshu will be back with the chase soon. <B>Here's the legspinner Peter:</b> "It's gone well if I can put it that way. Few stuff I can do better but happy to do this for the team. (First wicket) First wicket is always special. Definitely felt that all the hard work finally got a time to shine. (Target) Wicket is starting to crumble a bit but better wicket than yesterday. We can fancy our chances with the arsenal we've got. (From net bowler to playing for SA) Me being here shows that keep working hard. Sometimes you might not get chances, maybe its not the right time. Keep working, be patient."
