Lot happening, Nitish almost took a stunner running to the left from long-off. He then bulleted a throw to the keeper, who whipped off the bails but Dhaliwal made it. Quite cool how the fielder caught it on the bounce while sliding. Was a full ball that was flighted and driven inside out

Big appeal for lbw, not given. Jasdeep chats with the skip, USA decide to review. Good shout but height might be an issue. Was a length ball that angled in, beat the flick and hit over the knee-roll. <strong>Hawk-Eye projects that the ball would have gone over the top of the stumps</strong>

Pargat Singh run out (Jasdeep Singh/†Patel) 5 (7b 0x4 0x6 12m) SR: 71.42
Pargat returns for a risky second, accurate throw from Jasdeep and the keeper does well to whip off the bails. Run-out referral made. This could be out. <strong>Yep, he's a goner despite the full-length dive!</strong>. Monank got the throw angling at him, he swayed his hands to the right and dislodged the bails with the batter being about a foot short. Was a length ball that was flicked around the corner, off the back foot. Jasdeep ran to the right and flung the ball at pace. A very flat and fast throw

<strong>Sliced high and Little has taken a lovely catch running to his right from deep third.</strong> Length ball outside off, with just a hint of away shape. Pargat looks to go over cover, but the bat turns in his hand again, and he ends up skying the ball. Little sprints across, settles underneath the ball and completes a good catch. That was a wobble seam delivery from Young.
