Captain Rashid out to face the last ball. Can he finish with a flourish?

short and wide outside off. Rashid reaches out for it and cuts it towards deep cover point. A brace to end the innings
Sowmya : "An amazing come back from Uganda. At one point it seemed 224-240 was easily possible " <strong>10:11pm</strong> An innings of two halves really. In the first half, Afghanistan were rollicking along, with Gurbaz and Ibrahim putting the Ugandan bowlers to the sword. Both of them registered fifties and put together the second-highest opening stand ever in T20 World Cup cricket. Both, though, fell close to each other and that triggered a significant slow-down. Only 27 runs came off the last five overs and they failed to hit a boundary in the last six (scoring 31 and losing five wickets), which means they have ended up well short of what seemed certain at one point. Lots of credit for the slow-down has to be given to Uganda too. Post the drinks break, they recalibrated their plans, bowling tighter to the stumps and not giving the batters any width. Masaba led that turnaround and was the pick of the bowling bunch, bagging a couple of wickets along the way. Kyewuta also popped up with two scalps, with Ramjani removing Gurbaz. This may still be a tall order for Uganda, given Afghanistan's bowling might. But they are definitely chasing a much lower total than it seemed at the 14-over mark. Join us in a bit for the run-chase! <b>Ibrahim Zadran:</b> (On his form in the last few months) I am trying to keep it very simple. I don't try to think a lot. I am working hard, I want to be a great cricketer and want to enjoy my cricket. (On if the six was his favourite shot tonight) I think so, I middled it and I enjoyed that shot a lot. (On partnership with Gurbaz) If you look at our partnership, we have been playing together (for a long time). We have good communication and we know each other's game, and try to keep it simple. Me and Gurbaz were discussing to not go from the first ball. Check what the bowlers are doing and what ends they are bowling from.

<B>game, set, match. West Indies win by 104 runs.</b> Full ball around off, and Rashid tried to helicopter a six down the ground. But he ends up slicing it, and Powell at long off takes a tricky catch. West Indies finish as Group C toppers, while Afghanistan finish second. Not that it matters for the Super Eight, but definitely does for bragging rights and team morale.
Well, that's all from us. The Group Stage is done and dusted. The next time we meet, it will be the Super Eight stage, and South Africa v USA will kick that off in about 36 hours. Thank you for your company. Take care! <B>12.05am</b> Stick around for the presentation. We'll hear from the two captains soon.<BR><BR><B>Rashid Khan:</b> The way they batted, scoring around 90 runs in the powerplay, it is tough to come back from that. But in the middle overs we did well and it was good to restrict them under 200. But this game is good to understand mindset and strategy. Hope to not repeat. (Learnings) Good for us to keep it simple and not experiment. Better to stick with strengths on wickets like these than try too much. Hope to do better when it comes to similar pitches. (Big loss will affect Afghanistan?) Don't think so. We've achieved what we wanted - to get Super Eight. The different pitches coming up... we'll adjust to them. Good learning this loss happened at this stage, not in a do-or-die game. We take the positives with us, like fielding, middle-overs bowling and Noor's spell."<BR><BR><B>Rovman Powell:</b> (On eight straight wins) Shows hard work is paying off. (Motivation) The guys were excited to come here. We knew here will be one of the better wickets of the competition. After Guyana and Trinidad, the batters wanted to come here and get runs. (Pooran) I think it is on the back of hard work. He has had a very good 12 months. Good to see him score runs not only in franchise cricket but also for WI. (McCoy's bowling today) When I was bowling, I was telling him that we now have a headache [when it comes to selection]. We are playing in the West Indies, and it is our responsibility to make full use of home conditions. (Home fans) When we started the journey, we were 8th or 9th in the world. Now we are around 3rd in the world, and when you do well, the fans start believing. Guyana was lovely, Trinidad was a packed house, and to see the support St Lucia has given, it is amazing. (Sammy, head coach) I extend my thanks to him and our management. I have started as a young captain, but they have given me what I want. It has been a driving force in my success as a captain and in them believing in me as a leader." A reminder that today's result made no difference to the Super Eight line-ups because pre-seeding by the ICC had determined it already. Group 1 will have Afghanistan, India, Australia and Bangladesh. Group 2 will have the two co-hosts West Indies and USA, and with them South Africa and England. <B>11.40pm</b> Once Afghanistan began the second innings conceding a wicket-maiden over courtesy Akeal Hosein's drifting deliveries, the chase appeared very tough. It only got tougher when Afghanistan slipped from 45 for 1 to 59 for 4 in the space of two overs just after the powerplay ended. Obed McCoy then got stuck in with a searing three-over spell of 3 for 14, complementing the spinners Hosein and Gudakesh Motie spectacularly, and the other pacers picked off the tail to complete an all-round dominating show.<BR><BR>But don't forget the men who set up the game for West indies. Johnson Charles (43), Shai Hope (25) and Rovman Powell (26) got important runs, and played the perfect role as second-fiddle to Nicholas Pooran. Pooran smacked the tournament's highest individual score and led West Indies to the tournament's highest team total, and it was only a run-out that could stop him from getting to a ton. His 98 included eight sixes, and that has helped him go past Chris Gayle (124 sixes) as West Indies' most decorated T20I six-hitter. That's quite the achievement for the man who is still only 28.<BR><BR><B>Pooran is also the Player of the Match</b>. He talks about the ebb and flow of his innings, here are some highlights from his quotes (not verbatim): "I had to see the conditions early and take responsibility. In West Indies people want fours and sixes but you can't do that everytime, but when conditions allow, you should capitalise. We wanted to be consistent as a team from 12-14 months ago."
