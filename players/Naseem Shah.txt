We were looking at 140, but nevertheless the bowlers did the job. It was a good wicket compared to the one we played on here [against Ireland]. There's that never-say-die attitude in the team. Only 119 on the board, and we wanted to make early inroads which we didn't. But at the halfway stage we got together and said if things can happen to us, they can happen to them too. The little contributions from everyone makes the difference. Whoever has the ball wants to make the difference. Bumrah is going from strength to strength. I'm not going to talk too much about him, we want him to be in that kind of mindset till the end of this World Cup, he's a genius with the ball.

Fantastic win for India, puts them on top of their group above USA. Pakistan, well... they're in some trouble now. They've been in these situations before in world tournaments and come back from them, as we all know, so never say never. Anyway, we've just witnessed one hell of a contest, and my fingers need all the rest they can get. I shall take your leave, therefore, and bid you a warm goodbye on behalf of myself, Danyal, Thilak and Ranjith. Enjoy the rest of your Sunday! <b>Rohit Sharma</b>: "We didn't bat well enough.
