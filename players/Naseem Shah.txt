Over: 20
Pitch Line: OUTSIDE_OFFSTUMP Length: FULL_TOSS
Shot: STRAIGHT_DRIVE
Run scored: 1
All India need now is for Arshdeep to not bowl a wide or no-ball.

and he does his bit. Low full-toss on off stump, jabbed back down the ground, past the other end, and India have defended 119. What a performance, and what a match this has been
<b>3.57pm</b> And that is that. Fantastic win for India, puts them on top of their group above USA. Pakistan, well... they're in some trouble now. They've been in these situations before in world tournaments and come back from them, as we all know, so never say never. Anyway, we've just witnessed one hell of a contest, and my fingers need all the rest they can get. I shall take your leave, therefore, and bid you a warm goodbye on behalf of myself, Danyal, Thilak and Ranjith. Enjoy the rest of your Sunday! <b>Rohit Sharma</b>: "We didn't bat well enough. I thought halfway through, after 10 overs, we were in a good position, you expect guys to stitch partnerships. We were 15-20 runs short, and every run matters. We were looking at 140, but nevertheless the bowlers did the job. It was a good wicket compared to the one we played on here [against Ireland]. There's that never-say-die attitude in the team. Only 119 on the board, and we wanted to make early inroads which we didn't. But at the halfway stage we got together and said if things can happen to us, they can happen to them too. The little contributions from everyone makes the difference. Whoever has the ball wants to make the difference. Bumrah is going from strength to strength. I'm not going to talk too much about him, we want him to be in that kind of mindset till the end of this World Cup, he's a genius with the ball. The crowd was superb, they never disappoint, wherever we play in the world, they come out in huge numbers and support us. They'll be going home with a big smile on their face as well. Just the start of the tournament, we have a long way to go." <b>Babar Azam</b>: "I think they bowled well after 10 overs. We were chasing 120, we were run a ball for the first 10 overs, but back to back wickets and then [we left too much in the end]. Tactics was simple, play normally, rotate strike, 5-6 an over. But in that period we had too many dot balls, the pressure was on us, and we lost three quick wickets. Can't expect too much from tailenders. We were not up to the mark in the first six overs, we had targeted 40-45 runs, we have not capitalised properly. Pitch looked decent, ball coming nicely. Little bit slow, some balls are bouncing a bit more, but you expect it with a drop-in pitch." <b>Jasprit Bumrah is the Player of the Match</b>. "It feels really good," he says. "We felt we were a little under par, and when the sun came out, the wicket got a little better, so we had to be really disciplined. I tried to keep it simple, tried to hit the seam as much as I can, focus on my execution. It felt like we were in India, and the cheering is really appreciated, we were really happy with the support we got, it gave us a lot of energy. Focus on the now. We've played two games, played very good cricket. We'll stick to our processes, and come out and try our best." Mustafa Moudi : "That shot at 19.4 brings back the historical 2007 World Cup Winning Moment !!" Asahel: "@Karthik even then they would have to beat the NRR of USA. It's quite a gap" -- Yup. Enish: "Sure, India-Pak is the big hype, but don't let this game distract you from the fact England is <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/oman-vs-scotland-20th-match-group-b-1415720/full-scorecard">on the brink of getting knocked out</a> with Scotland cruising towards victory. As an Australian Cricket fan, gotta be honest here- I love this!" Arjit: "The terror of Bumrah is such that even his full tosses aren't dispatched, one was single and another got him the wicket." Nilesh Thakker : "I guess we underestimate Rishabh Pant's performance here.. 42 runs, 3 excellent catches.  He's my PoTM" Anser: "Pakistan is now almost out of the World Cup." -- They will need to beat Ireland and Canada now, and hope that USA lose to both India and Ireland. That's their route to the Super 8s, if my calculations are right. <b>3.38pm</b> Phew. The smallest total that India have successfully defended in T20Is. The lowest target that Pakistan have failed to chase down. Tears for Naseem as he walks off, with Shaheen's arm around his shoulder. Two teams gave it their all today, on a tricky, tricky pitch, and we've all witnessed a contest that's lived up to all the India-Pakistan hype. You always felt that Jasprit Bumrah would be key in defending a total this small, and he finishes with figures of 4-0-14-3. What a man. Excellent support from the other quicks too. Siraj has gone at below 5, and Hardik came back with 2 for 6 from two overs after conceding 18 in his first two. Utsav Mukherjee: "How important were the 16 runs from Arshdeep and Siraj! Incredible win!" Venkatesh : "How good was that bumrahs over 3 runs and 1 wkt, just extraordinary "
