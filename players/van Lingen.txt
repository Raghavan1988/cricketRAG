He cites the example of Adam Zampa, who has been bowling quite stump-to-stump as possibly the way to go and concludes it is a very good wicket overall. <b>Namibia XI:</b> Michael van Lingen, Nikolaas Davin, Jan Frylinck, Gerhard Erasmus (c), Zane Green (wk), David Wiese, Ruben Trumpelmann, JJ Smit, Bernard Scholtz, Jack Brassell, Ben Shikongo <b>Australia XI:</b> David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh (c), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stonis, Tim David, Matthew Wade (wk), Pat Cummins, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood <strong>8pm</strong> It's toss time. Marsh and Erasmus are out in the middle. Marsh gives it a spin. Tails is the call but heads it is. <strong>Australia will bowl first.</strong> Marsh says it is a nice wicket and they want to see how it fares. <strong>Ellis comes in for Starc, who "did not quite pull up from the last game", Marsh says.</strong> Adds that they are looking forward to the challenge tonight. Reckons both sides look a little short and that sort of makes it easier, rather than having just one short side. Erasmus says he would have bowled first too. He hopes he can pull off an upset by beating the "mighty" Australia. <strong>Three changes for Namibia. Youngster Jack Brassell gets a go, as does Ben Shikongo. There is a change at the top of the order too, with Michael van Lingen replacing JP Kotze.</strong> <strong>7:55pm</strong> Australia and Namibia have not played a competitive T20I yet. But they did meet in a warm-up game prior to this tournament, with Australia cruising to a seven-wicket win. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-warm-up-matches-2024-1434088/australia-vs-namibia-warm-up-1434095/match-report">Here is all that happened.</a> <strong>7:50pm</strong> As we get ready for today's action, you can catch up with the latest episode of ESPN's Around The Wicket</a> featuring Aaron Finch, Tim Paine and Lisa Sthalekar where they look back at the recent stories in the T20 World Cup. <b>7:40pm</b> This group stage has seen everything so far - whether it be Super Overs, upsets or fairy tale arcs. And that, as Andrew Fidel Fernando aptly writes, is <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/the-people-s-world-cup-why-the-2024-tournament-is-making-cricket-great-again-1438049">making cricket great again.</a> <b>7:30pm</b> A walk into the unknown. For both <b>Australia</b> and <b>Namibia</b>. Having only played in Barbados previously this T20 World Cup, they now move to Antigua, unaware of what could be in store. Australia and Namibia have also never played a T20I at this venue, whereas <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/australia-tour-of-west-indies-2008-319125/west-indies-vs-australia-2nd-test-319140/full-scorecard">Australia's last competitive international fixture was way back in 2008.</a> A walk into the unknown, though, also brings with it unparalleled intrigue. Neither knows what could happen, but both of them will also be aware of all that <em>can</em> happen. Australia, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-oman-10th-match-group-b-1415710/full-scorecard">after an iffy start against Oman</a>, got their <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-england-17th-match-group-b-1415717/full-scorecard">engine purring beautifully against England.</a> Almost all of their batters have, across two games, spent some time out in the middle and the cricketing grand slam, which might have felt ludicrous a year or so ago, does not seem as distinct a possibility anymore. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-namibia-24th-match-group-b-1415724/points-table-standings">Namibia are placed slightly more precariously.</a> They simply <em>must</em> win against a seemingly indomitable foe. Strange things, however, have happened in T20 World Cup cricket before, and there is precedent of a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-twenty20-2007-08-286109/australia-vs-zimbabwe-4th-match-group-b-287856/full-scorecard">lesser-fancied African side beating Australia in the group stage.</a> So, Namibia arrive in Antigua, perhaps slightly daunted but with belief that they can produce the game of their lives. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the <b>2024 men's T20 World Cup</b>. It is <b>Match 24</b> and we are at the <b>Sir Vivian Richards Stadium</b> in Antigua. The brief for Australia is clear: win and take their place in the Super Eight. The objective is even more straightforward for Namibia: win and stay alive in the competition. Hop on, this should be fun!
