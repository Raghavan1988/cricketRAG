<strong>8:31pm</strong> The players are already out in the middle now. van Lingen and Davin to open for Namibia. Hazlewood to take the new ball for Australia - here we go! <strong>8:29pm</strong> Looks like the <strong>covers are coming off now.</strong> Fingers crossed that this is the last we see of rain over the next four hours or so. <strong>8:27pm</strong> The national anthems are done but <strong>hang on...it has started drizzling and the covers are being brought on. Looks like we will have a slight delay to proceedings.</strong> <strong>8:23pm</strong> The players stride out, hand in hand with their mascots. We will have the national anthems before the start of play. Namibia's national anthem is up first and it will be followed by Australia's anthem. Ravi: "With all the talk of Australia qualifying with a win today and England needing to win against Oman and Namibia, wouldn't it be amazing if Namibia beat both Australia and England and Scotland beat Australia so Scotland and Namibia qualify for the next round?" <strong>8:20pm</strong> Australia bowl first, like they did against Namibia in the warm-up fixture. Namibia will want to make a better fist of things this time round. Starc is absent and that might make new-ball batting a little easier, although Cummins and Hazlewood are very capable inside the powerplay. <b>Adam Zampa:</b> If we play to full potential, we can definitely test it out at the back end. Playing good cricket at the right time is important. (On the breeze) We are pretty familiar with a lot of the Caribbean grounds. It is a conversation we have had. Lot of guys have played in the Caribbean and you have to make use of it, when batting and bowling. (On how he is feeling after the time off) Feeling great. Had a bit of family time to freshen up and this was my priority 100%. We played against them (Namibia) in the warm-up, got a bit of information and know a bit of their players now. Will be a challenge tonight for sure. <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> Relatively equal square boundaries - 65m to one side, 67m to the other. 75m hit straight down the ground. Aaron Finch says it looks a good wicket. Not a huge amount of grass but it does look very hard. It will be interesting to see the pace off the surface, Finch adds. He cites the example of Adam Zampa, who has been bowling quite stump-to-stump as possibly the way to go and concludes it is a very good wicket overall. <b>Namibia XI:</b> Michael van Lingen, Nikolaas Davin, Jan Frylinck, Gerhard Erasmus (c), Zane Green (wk), David Wiese, Ruben Trumpelmann, JJ Smit, Bernard Scholtz, Jack Brassell, Ben Shikongo <b>Australia XI:</b> David Warner, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh (c), Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stonis, Tim David, Matthew Wade (wk), Pat Cummins, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood <strong>8pm</strong> It's toss time. Marsh and Erasmus are out in the middle. Marsh gives it a spin. Tails is the call but heads it is. <strong>Australia will bowl first.</strong> Marsh says it is a nice wicket and they want to see how it fares. <strong>Ellis comes in for Starc, who "did not quite pull up from the last game", Marsh says.</strong> Adds that they are looking forward to the challenge tonight. Reckons both sides look a little short and that sort of makes it easier, rather than having just one short side. Erasmus says he would have bowled first too. He hopes he can pull off an upset by beating the "mighty" Australia. <strong>Three changes for Namibia. Youngster Jack Brassell gets a go, as does Ben Shikongo. There is a change at the top of the order too, with Michael van Lingen replacing JP Kotze.</strong> <strong>7:55pm</strong> Australia and Namibia have not played a competitive T20I yet.
