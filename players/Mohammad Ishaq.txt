<strong>taken at deep midwicket... but it is a no-ball!</strong> And it is nearly a run-out too. Ohh, the heel is just behind the line, seemingly. Yup, it is not a no-ball indeed. Anyway, he bowled full and straight, as Ishaq swung one across to deep midwicket

Mohammad Ishaq is OUT! caught
c Stirling b White
Mohammad Ishaq c Stirling b White 27 (22b 3x4 0x6 28m) SR: 122.72
<strong>great catch by Stirling!</strong> He was placed at extra cover, and turned around to move straight for a few steps. The ball was lofted miles above, and was dropping over his left shoulder as he tumbled forward to complete the take. White bowled one full around off from the back of his hand, as Ishaq mistimed his attempted loft

another sizzling yorker but this slides just down leg. Ishaq seems to miss it and the ball brushes the pads before flying past the keeper. That tailed back in but it was always going down leg

<strong>four to end the innings too!</strong> Cutter bowled way outside off. Ishaq throws the plumbing at it and slices it over short third man. Afghanistan finish with 209!
<strong>8:36pm</strong> A brilliant batting effort and it has taken Afghanistan up to 209. Gurbaz and Zazai tore into Sri Lanka inside the powerplay, ransacking 72. Gurbaz stuck around after the powerplay and while boundaries were tougher to come by, he ran excellently between the wickets to keep the score ticking. When Gurbaz was dismissed by Hasaranga, SL might have felt there was a window of opportunity, although that was slammed shut by Omarzai and Nabi, who combined for a 41-run stand. Nabi and Ishaq then applied the finishing touches, with 55 coming off the last five. Not a great bowling and fielding display by Sri Lanka. They dropped catches, bowled too short and full at the start and then gave away a host of extras towards the end. Pathirana picked up two, as did Dananjaya but they will look back at this performance as one they would not want to repeat. They have the batting firepower to chase this down. At this stage, however, Afghanistan will be the happier of the two sides. Join us in a bit for the run-chase!

darted down leg, and this time, Thushara is the guilty party. Gathered by Mendis, though, meaning that it is just a solitary extra
