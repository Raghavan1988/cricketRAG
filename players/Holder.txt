<b>Holder holes out!</b> Steps to leg and attempts to slog Mills over cow, but's another back-of-the-hander and he can't get the distance. Well held in the deep and that's the first part of the job done
<b>3.08pm:</b> A topsy-turvy innings, one that almost epitomised West Indies' time-honoured approach. They were in trouble at halfway, four down and barely going above a run a ball. But Brandon King, who anchored things superbly with 82 not out, and Rovman Powell suddenly hit their straps as West Indies ransacked 72 from the last 30 balls. It may only have got them to par, but they will feel in the game after finishing strongly. Here's King speaking to the host broadcaster: "It was quite difficult to start, low and slow. They assessed quickly that slower balls were the way to go. Fortunately we got a good partnership. [Personal runs] Was thinking about how many we needed to get a  target." Miller will be back for more in 10

<b>Australia win by 11 runs</b> in a good game of T20 cricket with plenty of runs. West Indies just left a little too much to do at the end. Zampa was the difference with the ball. Pooran, Russell and Rutherford didn't fire which was costly. The home side had been set up by David Warner's rollicking half-century and their innings was finished off by Tim David's power. These are two very good T20 sides. Rahul: "Zampa was really the difference b/w the two sides. On such a track even 3/40 would've been great but those 15 runs were the difference b/w both these teams." "Almost the perfect game," says Zampa. "Might have left a few out there. They are a dangerous team, a lot of power, the ability to keep taking wickets was important." <b>David Warner</b> is player of the match: "Just pleasing to get the win. You saw it was a nice wicket and have to make the most of those ones. I feel refreshed, a lot of energy, the guys have told me to calm down a bit. I've said I want to play the World Cup and finish there." <b>Rovman Powell</b> "Just in the middle we struggled to get partnership, but it was still a good game of cricket. We've just got to back ourselves a little bit more, whenever we raise our bat tonight we find a fielder. Think the guys did well, just the middle overs we kind of lost it a little. It's a little bit too cold for us, but the crowd was good and a good atmosphere." <b>Matthew Wade</b> (subbing in for Mitch Marsh) "I think he's okay. We respect them [West Indies] a lot, they are a great T20 team. We knew it wasn't going to be an easy win. We felt 200 was par so just had enough on the board. The luxury we have is the seven batters in the team. Nice to see Tim come in and smack it around. [Zampa] He's class, you can just bank on his four overs." I'm going to wrap things up there for tonight. Australia face South Africa in the deciding women's ODI tomorrow and we'll have coverage of that, then be back for the second game of this series on Sunday. For now, from Gnasher and Alex, it's goodnight.
