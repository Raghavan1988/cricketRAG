Shortish ball at the ribs, 143ks, Walsh tucks it with a jumping swivel, to deep-backward square
Anon: "Carty bats rather slow for modern ODIs, but looks solid. Wonder why his FC record is so poor. Apart from that, he looks like he could be a good Test player. Feel like he could have played a part in the recent Test series, given that 7 uncapped players were called up and he was not one of them. Additionally, I feel Da Silva could have played as an opener this ODI series as he often does for T"

Labuschagne makes amends with an excellent catch. Walsh charges at the short ball and pulls it to the right of deep midwicket. Labuschagne sprints to his right and puts in the slide to pouch it with both hands. And that also means no debut five-for for Bartlett
<b>6.05pm</b> The West Indies innings followed the bell curve: nothing at the start, nothing at the end but a century stand in the middle. Bartlett picked up three early to leave them on 59 for 4. Keacy Carty and Roston Chase added 110 for the fifth wicket. And then the last five wickets fell in 38 runs and West Indies were bowled out for 231.
