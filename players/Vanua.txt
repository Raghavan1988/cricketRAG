Omarzai to continue. Two slips in place now
Vanua is OUT! run out
run out (Rashid Khan)
Norman Vanua run out (Rashid Khan) 0 (7b 0x4 0x6 10m) SR: 0
<strong>has Vanua been run out?!</strong> Back of a length on middle and leg. Vanua bunts it to mid on and seems to call for the single. Always looked touch-and-go, from the moment he called for it. Rashid is on his toes, swoops in and hits the stumps at the bowler's end. <b>All eyes now on whether Vanua has made his ground. He seemed favourite to do so but his bat got stuck in the turf a centimetre outside the line.</b> That is really unfortunate, but that is also the third run-out in this innings for PNG!
