Zimbabwe were hit by a Josh Little-sized storm early and they could never get back into the game. He picked up three wickets in an over to reduce Zimbabwe to 15 for 3, which soon became 19 for 4. Clive Madande (33), Ryan Burl (38) and Wellington Masakadza (40) did steady the innings a bit but none of the other batters held fort. Little came back to remove Masakadza to take his fifth wicket before taking out Richard Ngarava for his sixth. Little's 6 for 36 are now the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/best-figures-in-an-innings-283204">best bowling figures</a> for an Irishman in ODIs. Gustav: "Zim has done pretty well here, considering they were 70/6 with a prediction of just 109 all out"
