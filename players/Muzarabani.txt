Adair is off the field. A lonnnggg team chat at the bowler's mark even as Blessing Muzarabani takes strike. Two to win, one for a Super Over. McCarthy taking his own sweet time to set his field. Short cover, mid-off, backward point, cover-point, midwicket, fine leg all in the ring. Long-on and deep backward square leg out. Wait, fine leg goes out

<strong>Inside edge, beats Tucker and Zimbabwe win!</strong> It is all happening and Harare finds its voice. Under lights for the first time. Ufff! McCarthy bowls to plan - full and just outside off. Muzarabani looks to hit one way but the ball goes the other. The wicketkeeper gets down but the ball beats him. And before fine leg cuts it off, they run two and <strong>seal the win that sees Zimbabwe go 1-0 up!</strong>
Right! That's all from us for tonight. Fingers do need some rest now, with the kind of end we have had. Do join us for the second T20I day after tomorrow. For tonight, on behalf of Ranjit and Abhimanyu, this is Sudarshanan bidding you goodbye. Thanks for your company. Till the next time, take care, adios! <b>10:18pm</b> Time for the presentation <b>Paul Stirling</b>, Ireland captain: "First of all it was a brilliant game. Hopefully we entertained the spectators here. Close game. You can point the loss at different directions but it was a good game. Not one area but we'll have a good look at different facts. We lost wickets in crucial points. Should have got to 160. We'll assess and come back better. [Bowlers] We picked up wickets at crucial points. That's how you close T20 games. A run here and there was crucial. [Adair catch] We work that out and it is not easy, especially at a new venue under lights." Zimbabwe captain <b>Sikandar Raza</b>, Player of the Match: "Nice to be part of history. Credit to fans for coming out in numbers. First game under lights, cracker of a game. Thought they got five to eight too many. Credit to Delany to have batted the way he did. Happy with the chase, credit to the batters. Made mistakes here and there but important that we got over the line. I am never a guy who looks into personal performances. I was gutted to have not finished the game. The little knock from Clive Madande was very crucial. Wessly got out at a wrong time. Pretty happy and proud of my team. Just wanted to tell Madande that if you remain positive, you'll see the ball better. When you give responsibility to these guys they do well. Everything that happens stays on the field." <b>10:08pm</b> Hold your breath. Uff! Let that drama sink in. A game for the ages. Ireland players walk off fully knowing they were a millimeter away from taking the lead this series. Zimbabwe players walk down to shake hands, fully aware that had Muzarabani attempted any othre shot, the win would have prolly not been theirs. A game of fine margins. A historic first international game under floodlights at the Harare Sports Club and sure it has been a memorable one. Spare a thought for Little and Young, who bowled some tight overs even as the game was getting tight with Zimbabwe having their noses ahead. Little knocked over the aggressive Madande to turn the tables. And then Adair struck what seemed like a telling blow with Raza's scalp. McCarthy kept his calm in crucial phases but it was just not enough. Zimbabwe have escaped to a win but will have to take a hard look at their batting, that once again cost them. It was all Raza with the bat after it was all Raza with the ball earlier, with a three-for. Graham: "Wow, what a match !!! Congrats Zim" Panashe: "Shhhhhhh this is one of the greatest escape from Zim"

<strong>That's that, Zimbabwe are all out for 166. </strong> Was a short of a length ball aimed at Muzarabani's body. He is cramped for room and can only heave it to mid-on.
<b>12.22pm</b> A grand chance for Ireland to take a 1-0 lead in this three-match series. Zimbabwe were hit by a Josh Little-sized storm early and they could never get back into the game. He picked up three wickets in an over to reduce Zimbabwe to 15 for 3, which soon became 19 for 4. Clive Madande (33), Ryan Burl (38) and Wellington Masakadza (40) did steady the innings a bit but none of the other batters held fort. Little came back to remove Masakadza to take his fifth wicket before taking out Richard Ngarava for his sixth. Little's 6 for 36 are now the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/best-figures-in-an-innings-283204">best bowling figures</a> for an Irishman in ODIs.

Blessing Muzarabani run out (Vandersay/†Mendis) 0 (2b 0x4 0x6 4m) SR: 0
good length ball on middle. Tucked to the leg side and they consider a single. But Blessing is sent back and in that time the fielder from square leg throws the ball to the keeper for a run-out. Is he out? He's a tall man, but that height will not matter today. Out by a few inches and that's a wicket thrown away. <B>That is three wickets in four balls</b>

<b>Seven-for for Hasaranga, best figures in ODIs for him</b>! Slips in a quick googly, pitching fuller than good length on middle. Muzarabani looks to defend but the ball is too quick for him and beats his bat to trap him in front
<strong>8:53pm</strong> Hasaranga all the way, as he showed what Sri Lanka missed all these months. A perfect wow-indu performance from the prime legspinning allrounder. <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=wickets;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings">Fifth-best bowling figures</a> in all men's ODIs. Zimbabwe were racing along after opting to bat, moving to 41 for 0 in eight overs. But after the first rain stoppage - of over two hours - snatched their momentum away. Hasaranga picked up three wickets in the short phase before the second rain stoppage, which spanned close to two and a half hours. The tourists never really found the momentum then and were bowled out for a paltry total. Will Zimbabwe manage to provide some resistance? Or will Sri Lanka hop, skip and jump away to a win? We'll find out when Ekanth returns with the start of the reply
