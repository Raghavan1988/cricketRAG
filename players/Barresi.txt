<strong>Barresi departs!</strong> Length delivery that pitches in the channel and decks back in sharply. Barresi, like O'Dowd, does not move his feet a lot and goes at it with his hands. The ball breezes past the inside edge and pins him on the back leg. Jessy appeals and the umpire raises his finger! USA are inching their way back into this contest!
<strong>2:19pm</strong> The powerplay belonged to the Netherlands but USA have started clawing their way back ever so slightly. Can they make this pressure count and trigger a Dutch collapse? Here is Peter to take you through the next passage of play.
