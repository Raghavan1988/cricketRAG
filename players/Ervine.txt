<strong>superb catch by Samarawickrama!</strong> He has patrolled that point region all day, and fielded well too. This time he threw himself full stretch to his right, with the ball sticking into his right hand to dent Zimbabwe's progress. Ideally, Ervine should have put this ball away, having got a shortish ball, which was wide of off. He went punching behind square, only for Samarawickrama to end his well-compiled innings
