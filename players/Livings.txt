<b>5.30pm:</b> I'm off for a lie-down.

Jacks lashed 24 off 9 from No. 3 while Salt raced to a 48-ball hundred, his second in a row and one hell of a response to going unsold in the IPL auction earlier today.

"The platform was set by the two lads at the top... to get back-to-back hundreds in T20 internationals is an unbelievable effort, so fair play to Salty," Livingstone says, speaking to Samuel Badree. "He's threatened to do it for a long time. He has incredible talent. It's really nice for him to be able to get us off to a flyer... It's a nice pitch. It does take a couple of balls to get used to it. The boundaries are pretty small."

Well hello there. This isn't going to plan for England's newly locked-in candidates for England's World Cup defence. Clearly some fragility still in evidence despite last week's fireworks. Rob: "Jacks has been poor with the bat and hasnt bowled at all yet is picked at 3 ahead of malan still rated 5 in the world?  Laughable" I'd stick with him for what it's worth. Much the same could have been said about Salt until this week!

<B>4.02pm</B> Well, that's a fine fightback from Pakistan, led by Imad Wasim's magnificent 2 for 19. Jos Buttler went loco for a while in his 84 from 51 and Will Jacks was fluent too. But the rest were a bit ropey, until Archer's late assault.  Shaheen closes out with three wickets, despite going at nine an over. That is a decent score, but England clearly had designs on 220-plus after reaching 96 for 1 at the half-way mark. Imad: "Slightly two-paced, a good length was holding a bit. Assessed early and tried to bowl length balls. I think 180 is a par score, happy given the way Jos played."
