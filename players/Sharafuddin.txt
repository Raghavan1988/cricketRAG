slaps this length ball to the cover boundary. Solid hit. Too much width, sat up nicely for him to give it his all. Held his shape nicely and walloped it away to beat Jaiswal.

Sharafuddin is OUT! caught
c Asalanka b Pramod Madushan
Sharafuddin Ashraf c Asalanka b Pramod Madushan 4 (9b 0x4 0x6 8m) SR: 44.44
<strong>ahh, good catch by Asalanka!</strong> He took it reverse cupped, and above his head, with his hands stretching up entirely. The ball went flat and hard, but Asalanka did well to grab it. Before that, Madushan went on the fuller side of a length just outside off. Ashraf was standing deep in the crease for just about that length, as he went flaying at it, only for the ball to land into Asalanka's hands
