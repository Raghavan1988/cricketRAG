Van der Dussen looks like an addition to the list of batters falling in the attempt to manufacture a shot on this pitch. Given lbw, he reviews. He went across and was on one knee for the reverse sweep - back leg outside off and front leg on off. The ball is around a length, pitched outside off and hit the outer-edge of the left thigh. Impact is in line with off and it'd go on to crash middle. Plumb deluxe

A day to forget for South Africans Heinrich Klaasen annd Aiden Markram.
