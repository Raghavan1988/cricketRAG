Aaron Hardie b Shepherd 16 (16b 2x4 0x6 24m) SR: 100
<b>got him! </b> Full outside off, takes an inside edge as he drags it into the stumps. A difficult stay for Hardie. West Indies earned that
Inglis at No. 4 ahead of Maxwell. Interesting move. MW: "Both teams scored 3 runs in the 12th over. Random stat I know, but quite bizarre in such a high scoring match."
