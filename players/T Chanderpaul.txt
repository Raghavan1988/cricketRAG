Andrew: "Ball tracking is available a few seconds after the delivery. Teams usually take the whole 15 seconds to decide whether to review an LBW. If the umpire sent every close LBW shout straight to DRS and they played the ball-tracking immediately, the game would be going again in about 10 seconds, most of the time. If ball-tracking disagrees with the on-field call, then take the time (Usually 60 seconds) to check for an edge. Keeps the game  moving and gets every decision checked." Ball tracking actually takes awhile to build in the broadcast truck. Often 30 seconds plus. Hence they do it last in the DRS

Andrew: "Ball tracking is available a few seconds after the delivery. Teams usually take the whole 15 seconds to decide whether to review an LBW. If the umpire sent every close LBW shout straight to DRS and they played the ball-tracking immediately, the game would be going again in about 10 seconds, most of the time. If ball-tracking disagrees with the on-field call, then take the time (Usually 60 seconds) to check for an edge. Keeps the game  moving and gets every decision checked." Ball tracking actually takes awhile to build in the broadcast truck. Often 30 seconds plus. Hence they do it last in the DRS

Jan: "So Hazelwood is removed from the attack after a wicket maiden and Starc is removed after a maiden, how's the pitch playing?" There's a bit there for the quicks. Good bounce and carry. But it looks like it will turn into an excellent batting strip when the shine goes and the ball softens. This is the most difficult period.
