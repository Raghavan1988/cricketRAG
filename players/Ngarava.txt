Richard Ngarava c Adair b McCarthy 5 (4b 1x4 0x6 8m) SR: 125
<strong>YOU CANNOT DO THAT MARK ADAIR!</strong> You cannot do that. Adair has pulled out one of the greatest catches in the sport. No exaggeration. McCarthy bowls another off-pace length ball angling away, instead of working it through the on side, Ngarava goes for the big heave across the line and gets a thick outside edge. Seems to have made enough contact to beat short third running back. But Adair, while doing so, has his eyes on the ball, leaps, dives takes it and lands on his neck. A calm clap from the bowler even as Adair gathers himself

<strong>Swings it through the leg side</strong>. Ngarava, you beauty. Gets the Harare crowd back on its feet. Sees the length ball from McCarthy around middle and leg. Gives it the almighty heave through square leg. Slower offcutter, change of pace, nothing matters for Ngarava and his agricultural pull

<strong>Bowled him! </strong>Short of a length ball on the stumps, wild swing from Ngarava and fails to hit the ball, crashed onto the stumps. Zimbabwe fell 5 runs short
That's all there is to it for now. It was a delight to have you here, and I sincerely appreciate you joining. For the fifth Twenty20 International, please tune in at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka, on May 12 at 10 am. On behalf of Vairavan and the entire crew, Rashad is here to sign off till then. Farewell and good night. <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto: </strong> The way Tamim and Soumya batted we are very happy with them. Wicket was not that good but we should have batted a little bit more carefully. Hopefully we will comeback next match. We all know the wicket is tricky. But credit goes to Soumya and Tamim. They (Zimbabwe) also bowled very well. I think throughout the series our bowlers bowled very well. Today when Shakib came into the side he gave more confidence to the team. I think that's all we expect from them and I hope they will continue that." <strong>Player of the Match Mustafizur Rahman:</strong> "I always wanted to do well for the country doesn't matter where I play, whether it's the franchise or national team. National team always comes first. The pitch was a bit slow and helped me to excel today." <strong>Sikandar Raza:</strong> "Again we keep getting closer and closer. One thing I am very proud about are the youngsters, the way they are performing and showing courage. These are lot of positives in their batting as well. Fielding lapses here and there costed us few runs. Bangladesh fielded very well as well, especially the last boundary their skipper saved, that would have made the difference. But the biggest thing is I think my runs are crucial to the team and since I am not scoring, adding value to the victory. (Bowling unit) Some of the guys who bowled 2 overs spell went over 20 for none. I am one of those guys who always backed them. From the bowling point of view we were fantastic. But then again in the last few days we have been bowling really well but the batting unit keeps letting us down. We lose a cluster of wickets, we lose 1-2-3 wickets then build a 30 run partnership then we lose 2-3 wickets again. I can live with that Shamim bhai because this is a very inexperienced side. If they don't make mistakes then they don't learn. A lot of the mistakes have beeen there, a lot of positives have been there." <strong>Presentation ceremony: </strong> Zimbabwe, who had gone so close to winning the first game of the series, lost again. Bangladesh's X-factor was Mustafiz. The Fizz kept Bangladesh in the game despite the fielders missing a lot of catches. In the penultimate over, Shanto's outstanding effort close to the long on boundary ropes was also very important. After Campbell's solid knock, Wellington and Akram had brief cameos. Mustafizur, Rishad, and Taskin bowled precise lines and lengths. The remaining bowlers were somewhat expensive. Nabil: "So BD dropped 3 catches, got bundled out for 144 after being 100 for no loss in abt 10 overs and still managed to win the match. ZIM has been that poor today. Why in the world would Masakadza take a single of the first bowl of the last over is still beyond me." <strong>Bangladesh won the match by 5 runs</strong>
