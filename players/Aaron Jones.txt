<b>chaos! Missed runout!</b> Jones pokes a good length ball to mid-on and wants a single. Modani isn't interested and stays put. Jones had set off and was halfway down before scrambling back. The throw from Rohit Paudel to the keeper is just wide to allow Jones to get back in. A direct hit would have nailed him by a few inches.
