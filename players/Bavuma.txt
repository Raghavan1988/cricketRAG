Mujeeb is back A A Musabbir : "looks like cramp is a blessing in disguise for batters. It helps to concentrate more in the game. Examples are Rizwan, Maxwell, Bavuma etc." -- Not sure if this is cramp, though. Bavuma seemed to be struggling when SA were fielding too, and this looks more like a hamstring issue
