this one seems to have seamed back in and has beaten a whippy shot from Sudharsan. <b>Appeal for an lbw</b>, not given, and not reviewed either. The bat has hit the boot producing two sounds, something similar to what happened first ball of the first innings. Ball tracking shows hitting middle stump, not even leg.

<strong>brutish delivery, and it gets the better of Sudharsan!</strong> Hard length outside off and this kicks up off the surface. Sudharsan is shaping for the cut but by the time his bat comes down, the ball whistles off the glove through to Klaasen. The keeper is taken aback by the extra pace and bounce too, and parries it up into the air once before holding on. Crucial wicket for South Africa!
