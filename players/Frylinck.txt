Shot: FLICK

Shorter, skiddier, into the hip. Frylinck tries to work around the corner but ends up wearing it for a leg bye.... <strong>and it's a no ball!</strong> Poor end of a brilliant over from Wheal. Free hit incoming...

Edged... and beyond first slip! Right through where second would have been. Scotland do have a gully, but no second means Namibia are off the mark with a boundary

Makes room, <strong>drives on the up through cover!</strong> Not quite timed and the fielders almost chased that down, but some necessary intent from Frylinck, even if he only makes contact with the outside half of his bat

Short, lifts off a length and flies over the keeper! Thankfully, it's not all the way to the boundary, allowing first slip to collect. Wided by the umpire and rightly so

<strong>Dragged on!</strong> Frylinck tries to hack across the line in a bid to, well, ignore the swing, but ends up under-edging onto his stumps! Awful shot, but a deserved dismissal for Currie. Scotland are up and about!
