Anyway, Suryakumar Yadav has walked out to take Rohit's place at No. 4. My colleague Sampath tells me <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask/cricket-qna/most-sixes-by-a-batter&tournament=allintls>Rohit had just crossed 600 sixes in all international cricket</a>

length ball, Pant swings across the line... takes a blow on the body. He's hurt now, too. Took a smack on the left elbow. Going to need some treatment from the physio
Never mind low scores, injuries to one or more of the batters might be more likely to have repercussions for the surface...

Stick around for more from our man in NY (state), Sid Monga, and join us again as the T20WC continues to explore new frontiers. Bye! Comprehensive from India. Now why not settle down with our post-match show, Timeout Live, featuring <b>Sanjay Manjrekar</b> and <b>Andy Flower</b> Ireland captain <b>Paul Stirling</b>: "It was a tough one, the toss played a pretty crucial part, the pitch did a lot and we weren't up to that challenge. India bowled well and put us under pressure. It was how to go about it, wanted to put pressure back on the bowlers but everything we tried went up in the air. Their lengths were outstanding. We've got a big game or two coming up any time out in the middle is crucial. Hopefully gives us a better run come Friday [against Canada]." India captain <b>Rohit Sharma</b>: [Injury?] "Just a little sore. New ground, new venue, wanted to see what's it like to play on. I don't think the pitch settled down, there was enough there for the bowlers. Good to get the points. Stick to your basics, think about Test match bowling. Arshdeep can swing the ball into the right-handers and that set the tone. Don't think we can play four spinners here. If the conditions are there for the seamers, we wanted them in the squad. The spinners will play their part later in the tournament. We are open to making changes to the team's needs. [Pakistan] I don't know what to expect from the pitch but we will prepare as if conditions are going to be like that. That will be a game where all XI of us need to come together and contribute. It was scratchy but good to spend time in the middle, hopefully we can do the same [against Pakistan]." <b>Jasprit Bumrah</b> is named Player of the Match for his figures of 2 for 6: "When you come here and the ball is seaming around with some bounce and pace, I would never complain. You have to be proactive, you can't preempt things. You realise how the wicket is and then go back to what works for you. Once the seam goes down the pitch does settle down. You have to be prepared to bowl in all conditions, so very happy today."

Deep-backward square leg runs back and watch the ball fly over his right shoulder and into the cushion. Not sure if he misjudged it or was standing too near. Was a length ball just over the pad, which Pant hopped across and helped along with the pull. Went flat

Wobble ball beats the cut. It landed around off and Pant perhaps expected the ball to go wider, went hard and square, gets cramped for room. Beaten

<strong>Pant can do nothing about the shooter from around the wicket</strong>, Middle stump is bent halfway back. Ali wheels away and the batter has to walk back in resignation. Was a length ball that landed well outside off and angled back in sharply, looked to have gone under the bat and deflected off the pad and back onto the stumps. Pant's instincts had him on the back foot for the straight-bat punch, the bat was much higher up too. Not much he could've done about it.
