<strong>edged and taken by Smith at second!</strong> Oh dear. First up swing fooled Shafique. The second was full and angled across wide of off but it didn't swing, Shafique was half-committed trying to drive and gets a healthy edge and Smith takes an easy catch wait high at second. Horror start for Pakistan

The players head to the middle. Shafique and Ayub are opening up. There was a thought yesterday that the order may change and Ayub could come in in the middle order but he is opening. Starc has the new ball. Three slips and a gully. Shafique on strike. Nauman: "Resting Afridi, dropping Imam, selecting Saim are all very bold moves. Hats off to Shan and Hafeez for that. Difficult but right decision." <strong>10.20am</strong> The players head out for the anthems. Warner is greeted by his three daughters who are wearing Australia Test shirts with "Warner 31" on the back. His wife is there too. He is wearing a brand new baggy green though. His old ones still haven't been returned despite a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/david-warner-makes-plea-for-return-of-his-missing-baggy-green-1415010">plea for them after they went missing.</a> Warner is mic'd up on Fox as he walks out: "It's pretty special to walk out with my daughters." Graham: "I am not of the same view as Clint but in 12 months time will we remember Warners last 3 years or his early career. We dont have a lot of output to replace in the recent history," Here is his last <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/219889.html?class=1;spanmin1=01+Jan+2021;spanval1=span;template=results;type=batting;view=innings">three years in Tests</a>. His average of 30.87 is pretty mediocre. But it is still higher than the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bancroft-renshaw-or-harris-the-big-call-over-who-replaces-david-warner-1414557">Test averages</a> of Matt Renshaw, Marcus Harris and Cameron Bancroft. orkydd: "It is fascinating how Warner is the lightning rod to which most approbation goes for Australia's cheating at Newlands. The silver lining is that the severity of punishments handed out by Cricket Australia had the salutory effect of virtually eliminating ball tampering ever since. Reverse swing becomes once more a serendiptious occurrence, which no longer gets 'helped'. Compare the kid glove treatment of SA and English captains and players in their own malfeasences" Chad: "In regards to Warner, there is no doubt he has performed brilliantly on home wickets. But the media seem to forget his record on overseas pitches, nowhere near as good. Also there is always the incident in South Africa where the majority of people believe Warner was the villain." <strong>10.10am</strong> Fahad : "Hi there, didn't sleep and wanted to see Saim Ayub's Debut. It's 3:50 AM in Pakistan" Lots of excitement about Ayub. Simon Helmot, Pakistan's stand in high performance coach, has thrown a lot of balls to Ayub on this tour and he mentioned in Melbourne that he has been very impressed by his talent. Clint: "Re Warner: Good riddance. Though I doubt this will be published as it doesn't conform to the glowing praise and deification from most of the media." You're not the only one who thinks this way Clint. Warner divides opinion. I'd be curious for your thoughts in 12 months time when we've seen how his replacement has gone in their first year in the role. Raji: "Seriously? Rested after 2 matches? " Lots of people querying this. One thing to bare in mind, Afridi has bowled 99 overs in the series. That is 30 more than the next most on either team. Nathan Lyon has only bowled 69. No other quick in the series has bowled more than Aamer Jamal's 64.2. Cummins is Australia's most worked quick with 64. Starc has bowled 63.2. Jay from Canada: "Having followed Davey for a while, I am sure we are going to miss him. Someone who can single handedly change the course of the test match in a couple hours-only people like Viru, Sir Viv in the past come to mind. I vividly remember the Perth test between India and Aus in Dhoni's  captaincy and Dhoni said- we were pretty even but for Warner's knock. All the best Davey- hope you sign off with a 100 -a daddy one!" <strong>10.00am Toss</strong> Pakistan have won the toss and <strong>will bat first.</strong> <strong>Shan Masood</strong>: "Just how things are done at the SCG. Hopefully we can put in a good first innings score and then see how it plays. Very excited about Saim Ayub. We feel that he's one batter that's going to set the tone for Pakistan in terms of the batting unit going ahead. It looks pretty dry underneath the grass, so we might expect after day three for the pitch to be variable in terms of bounce. It might take a bit of spin, that's why we included Sajod Khan as well. Unfortunately Shaheen is resting." <strong>Pat Cummins</strong>: "Looks like a good wicket. The sun is out today. But that's fine. It's a short turnaround but everyone is in a good space and happy with how everyone is going. It's rare to play the same team three games in a row but it's nice." <strong>Australia</strong>: 1 David Warner, 2 Usman Khawaja, 3 Marnus Labuschagne, 4 Steven Smith, 5 Travis Head, 6 Mitchell Marsh 7 Alex Carey (wk), 8 Mitchell Starc, 9 Pat Cummins (capt), 10 Nathan Lyon, 11 Josh Hazlewood <strong>Pakistan</strong>: 1 Abdullah Shafique, 2 Saim Ayub, 3 Shan Masood (capt), 4 Babar Azam, 5 Saud Shakeel, 6 Mohammad Rizwan (wk), 7 Agha Salman, 8 Sajid Khan, 9 Hasan Ali, 10 Mir Hamza, 11 Aamer Jamal <strong>9.50am</strong> Pakistan's players have had some good moments in this series but no one has performed as consistently than our correspondent Danyal Rasool who has written beautifully covering this tour. He was across the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shaheen-shah-afridi-rested-for-third-australia-test-saim-ayub-to-debut-and-imam-ul-haq-dropped-1415159">Pakistan team changes</a> yesterday with Afridi being rested, Imam being dropped, Saim Ayub making his Test and Sajid Khan coming in. Waqar Younis has had some strong words on Channel Seven about Afridi resting.

His first Test captain Michael Clarke has made <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/michael-clarke-david-warner-s-value-stopped-his-contract-being-ripped-up-1415210">some interesting comments</a> about Warner on ESPN's new show Around The Wicket. For those interested, here is the full show. Mustafa Moudi : "As if the difficulty to digest the fact the Warner wont be opening for Australia in Test after this series wasnt enough, he gave us another shock by retiring from ODI as well. Warner will be missed in both the long formats. Thank you for all the Entertainment over the years !!" <strong>9.30am</strong> Good morning from a sunny SCG. The weather looks glorious. We're ready for the final Test of the series between Australia and Pakistan. Australia have won the series 2-0 after a thrilling win <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/pakistan-in-australia-2023-24-1375835/australia-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-1375843/full-scorecard">in Melbourne</a>. But there's plenty of interest in this game as David Warner bids farewell to Test cricket. Alex Malcolm and Rvel Zahid will be commentary today. Andrew McGlashan and Danyal Rasool are at the SCG for the New Year's Pink Test. Here is the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/pakistan-in-australia-2023-24-1375835/australia-vs-pakistan-3rd-test-1375844/match-preview">match preview</a>. Gnasher has written a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/david-warner-scg-farewell-an-all-format-great-who-divided-opinions-all-the-time-1415074">scene-setter for Warner's final Test</a>, looking back on his amazing journey to this point. Here is Gnasher from the SCG: "Morning from the SCG. No need to worry about the weather today, it's a lovely day. Plenty of interest in the surface. Has a decent covering of grass but wouldn't call it green. Surely it's a bat first day. The curator has worked hard to try and revive the pitches here. They experimented a bit during the Sheffield Shield, but the Test surface retains the traditional SCG grass. Pace and bounce will be key. Of course, all eyes will be on David Warner (and whether his baggy green has been returned). Does his career have a final memorable moment?"

141kph, shaping back into the right hander nicely, it hits high on the back thigh. Some real swing there
