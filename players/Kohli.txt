<b>1.07pm</b> Hello again, everyone. Cheers, Shashank. SA could've had India five down had they not dropped both Iyer and Kohli. They might have been in an even better position had they bowled with greater discipline with the new ball in helpful conditions. As it stands, India have worked their way back into the contest, thanks to Iyer and Kohli. Can the pair press on and keep SA under pressure on a pitch that would've dried up? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-in-south-africa-2023-24-1387592/south-africa-vs-india-1st-test-1387603/live-match-blog-1">Since Kohli and Iyer came together</a>, they've middled it 59 times and gotten 51 runs including six fours and a six. Rabada will start proceedings after lunch. He will operate from over the wicket. Roshan: "Ashwin will be the best batter for India in this test (may be even for the series if he plays both tests), I believe" Sandeep Mathew: "SA have bowled and fielded clumsily in first session and were fortunate for few wickets. Don't recall such an errant performance with the ball from SA attack in recent times!" maddy: "I actually feel Indian batting has more depth than SA. If India can up a 250  score here, they can fancy their chances. "

dug in short and jags away outside off, Kohli stabs at it away from his body but somehow keeps it down as the ball rolls away to gully

<b>1.07pm</b> Hello again, everyone. Cheers, Shashank. SA could've had India five down had they not dropped both Iyer and Kohli. They might have been in an even better position had they bowled with greater discipline with the new ball in helpful conditions. As it stands, India have worked their way back into the contest, thanks to Iyer and Kohli. Can the pair press on and keep SA under pressure on a pitch that would've dried up? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-in-south-africa-2023-24-1387592/south-africa-vs-india-1st-test-1387603/live-match-blog-1">Since Kohli and Iyer came together</a>, they've middled it 59 times and gotten 51 runs including six fours and a six. Rabada will start proceedings after lunch. He will operate from over the wicket. Roshan: "Ashwin will be the best batter for India in this test (may be even for the series if he plays both tests), I believe" Sandeep Mathew: "SA have bowled and fielded clumsily in first session and were fortunate for few wickets. Don't recall such an errant performance with the ball from SA attack in recent times!" maddy: "I actually feel Indian batting has more depth than SA. If India can up a 250  score here, they can fancy their chances. "

<strong>What a ball from Rabada!</strong> He has Kohli nicking off. Nice and full once again from Rabada. He was a bit too short in the morning session. This is a perfectly-pitched delivery, angling in at off. So Kohli has to play at this. It then jags away late to take the outside edge, which is held by Verreynne. Rabada has tipped it SA's way post lunch. You're never in, in these conditions

Virat Kohli c Ibrahim Zadran b Naveen-ul-Haq 29 (16b 5x4 0x6 20m) SR: 181.25
<strong>chipped to mid-off!</strong> The bat turned in his hands as he lofted that, and that was a hint that it wasn't well timed. Ibrahim at mid-off barely had to move to his left, and take it high with a reverse cup, as Kohli went lifting this full delivery just outside off. But the ball seemed to have come off the bottom of the bat, which turned as he looked to loft

<strong>this is liberal hitting from Kohli!</strong> Gets low at this length ball on off, and slog sweeps across the line almost as if Naveen were a spinner. Four hit wide of long-on

<strong>Netravalkar turns into left-arm Anderson to nick off Kohli</strong>. Perfect three-quarter length in the channel,  lands just outside off and keeps going away with the angle. Kohli went back and across, big step, and felt for it. The push with the full bat-face was firm and by the time he realised the angle was too far and tried withdrawing the bat, it was too late. There was the first-ball rust in there. No foot movement, all hands, and like in Nottingham 2021, he falls for a goldie
