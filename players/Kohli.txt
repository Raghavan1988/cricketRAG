They might have been in an even better position had they bowled with greater discipline with the new ball in helpful conditions. As it stands, India have worked their way back into the contest, thanks to Iyer and Kohli. Can the pair press on and keep SA under pressure on a pitch that would've dried up? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-in-south-africa-2023-24-1387592/south-africa-vs-india-1st-test-1387603/live-match-blog-1">Since Kohli and Iyer came together</a>, they've middled it 59 times and gotten 51 runs including six fours and a six. Rabada will start proceedings after lunch. He will operate from over the wicket. Roshan: "Ashwin will be the best batter for India in this test (may be even for the series if he plays both tests), I believe" Sandeep Mathew: "SA have bowled and fielded clumsily in first session and were fortunate for few wickets.
