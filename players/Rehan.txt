<b>6.42pm:</b> Right then. The players are back out in the middle, Rehan Ahmed is taking strike. Shall we? <b>6.32pm:</b> We have a restart time! <b>Play will resume at 6.45pm</b>, the game now 40 overs a side. Which means, somehow, we have only lost six overs in total despite being off for about 45 minutes. Don't ask me... but England's eighth-wicket pair will be back out there shortly Riddymon: "Surely DL will be leaning heavily in favor of West Indies at this point of the match, no?" Yes, it will certainly nudge the scales their way <b>6.21pm:</b> "Stumps in the ground," says Cam. "Umps are out having a look." Will England get to continue batting or won't they? The excitement is palpable "I presume any time lost will take overs away from both teams.. so England could maybe get a handful more overs and West Indies overs reduced further from the 43?" Your guess is as good as mine, Adam. But we'll find out soon enough <b>6.18pm: The covers are coming off! </b>So reports Cam Ponsonby, who is in training to one day cover Asia Cup rain delays <b>6.05pm:</b> Evening all. Looks like a fairly heavy squall is making its way across Kensington Oval right now. A delay in the range of half an hour or more would pretty much wipe out the rest of the England innings "How many overs do WI need to bat for it to be a game?" We'll need 20 to make it an ODI, JT. Even if it's a T20-style thrash (in which format, five overs would be enough...) Here's Alan to wrap up the innings, or not as the case may be... because <B>the rain is back!</B>. Bah humbug. That's tremendously bad timing. West Indies might be satisfied though, this partnership was being pretty resolute. And any reduction in overs from here will favour a T20-style biff for glory.

steps away and swats another boundary off the final ball, bouncing away wide of long-on - <b>but West Indies take victory</b>, a 10-run margin enough for a 2-0 series lead
<b>5pm:</b> Andre Russell finishes it for West Indies again, albeit not quite with the same amount of style and certainty as the other night. His most-expensive figures in T20Is come in a narrow win, as Sam Curran's maiden half-century and a string of batting cameos are not enough to get England over the line. It was, in the final analysis, a hard-fought contest, West Indies recovering from 54 for 4 thanks to a stand of 80 in 7.4 overs between Brandon King and Rovman Powell. England couldn't produce anything so substantial, as regular wickets kept them behind the 8-ball right until the end. TNT Sports, meanwhile, have elected to finish their coverage without going to the presentations, so that's our lot for tonight. Join us again for game three from Grenada on Saturday. Bye!

right into the blockhole, squeezed to deep square leg, they complete two and then see the ball race past the off-side ring for four overthrows. <b> Given five, not six </b> as replays suggest the batters hadn't crossed on their way to the second run.

Rehan is OUT! caught
c †Bharat b Bumrah
Rehan Ahmed c †Bharat b Bumrah 13 (18b 1x4 0x6 21m) SR: 72.22
<b> beautiful bowling from Bumrah! </b> He comes up with these magic slower balls time and again, when batters least expect it. This one cuts back in wildly from outside off, Rehan is foxed by this, and because he's already hung his bat out, it's too late to bail out. The ball kisses the inside edge and carried through to Bharat, who dives forward to complete an excellent catch.
