It was, in the final analysis, a hard-fought contest, West Indies recovering from 54 for 4 thanks to a stand of 80 in 7.4 overs between Brandon King and Rovman Powell. England couldn't produce anything so substantial, as regular wickets kept them behind the 8-ball right until the end. TNT Sports, meanwhile, have elected to finish their coverage without going to the presentations, so that's our lot for tonight. Join us again for game three from Grenada on Saturday. Bye!
