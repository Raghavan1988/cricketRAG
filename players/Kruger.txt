Malan Kruger c Jones b Greaves 2 (8b 0x4 0x6 13m) SR: 25
Good length, swung down on the charge and <strong>excellently taken by Michael Jones out at wide long on!</strong> As casual as you like, couple of strides towards the boundary before taking it over his shoulder and ensuring his momentum did not taken him anywhere near the sponge.

Kruger gets this away to deep fine leg where two fielders run around the boundary line to intercept. But a bit of miscommunication means they are late to react, and the ball is deemed a four. <B>South Africa finish on 161 for 7</b>
When we return, it will be Himanshu once again to call the first half of the chase. <B>3.31pm</b> Joseph bowls the tough overs and finishes with 2 for 24. Motie's 2 for 21 was solid too. A strong comeback from West Indies in the back end to keep South Africa down to 161 after Rassie van der Dussen and co. threatened to post a bigger total. Rassie's half-century and Mulder's 36 aside, South Africa were ordinary with the bat for most of the innings. West Indies kept control for most of the 90 minutes. <B>Obed McCoy:</b> "Pretty good, especially from the last game where I didn't do very good. I didn't get the lengths right last time. (lack of back of the hand slower balls) I use it based on the pitch. Here cutters work. (Catches) I got a bruise from the King catch!"
