Kruger gets this away to deep fine leg where two fielders run around the boundary line to intercept. But a bit of miscommunication means they are late to react, and the ball is deemed a four. <B>South Africa finish on 161 for 7</b>
When we return, it will be Himanshu once again to call the first half of the chase. <B>3.31pm</b> Joseph bowls the tough overs and finishes with 2 for 24. Motie's 2 for 21 was solid too. A strong comeback from West Indies in the back end to keep South Africa down to 161 after Rassie van der Dussen and co. threatened to post a bigger total. Rassie's half-century and Mulder's 36 aside, South Africa were ordinary with the bat for most of the innings. West Indies kept control for most of the 90 minutes. <B>Obed McCoy:</b> "Pretty good, especially from the last game where I didn't do very good. I didn't get the lengths right last time. (lack of back of the hand slower balls) I use it based on the pitch. Here cutters work. (Catches) I got a bruise from the King catch!"

a slower one from Joseph. Kruger prepped himself to play a reverse-sweep ramp over conventional short third but he mistimes a shot to the keeper's right after being deceived by the lack of pace

Yorker length ball just outside leg and Kruger is totally nutmegged with his feet spread trying to protect himself. Fletcher can't take it cleanly, and that's a bye run
