<strong>Ireland have done it!</strong> Dockrell finishes the job with two balls to spare, slicing it above short third! The series is level. Dockrell with a calm, composed celebration. Burl will lead Zimbabwe off the pitch after another cracker of a game, despite the hosts falling short this time
<b>4.50pm</b> So that is all from us today. Join us tomorrow at the same time for the series decider, which, if the first two games are anything to go by, should be a cracking contest. This is Abhimanyu, signing off on behalf of Binoy George and K Vairavan. Ciao, people! <b>4.42pm</b> <b>Time for the presentation ceremony!</b> <b>Harry Tector</b> the player of the match: "Absolutely! It feels like every game against Zimbabwe goes to the last over. [On partnership with Campher] It's certainly a period as a middle order we have spoken about. Happy with how we've done there. Obviously disappointed to get out when I did but happy the lads finished the job. I think the top three we have is world class and they've been doing that for a long time so long may they continue." <b>Paul Stirling</b>: "[On Tector and Campher] That was a real mature partnership by those two batters. Real sign of the maturity they've shown in the last couple of years. [On Ireland's slow start with the bat] I think that's just T20 cricket. Zimbabwe's opening bowlers bowled well. I think there's no real excuse for our fielding not being up to the highest standards. We need to bring it tomorrow." <b>Ryan Burl</b>, standing in for stand-in captain Sean Williams: "Unfortunately one of those things, he's [Williams] got a niggle. Very good start by our guys at a top but unfortunately a cluster of wickets in the middle. We consolidated in the end but we were probably 15-20 runs short. [On Kamunhukamwe] Nice to see him make the most of this opportunity. The boys are always looking to learn and always taking on as much information on board. Unfortunately we didn't put enough runs to defend. [On the Bennett over] One of those things that are high-risk, high reward. <Hr> Don't go anywhere, we will bring you the updates from the post-match presentation soon! Thamizhachi : "If catches win matches, drops lose you matches. Marumani dropped the match for Zimbabwe ! Had he taken the catch , 2 runs would have been stopped, new batter on strike !!! " DaWolf: "Absolutely dropped the match there! Followed by the boundary. Cruel game." <b>4.35pm</b> So, there we have it! Another exciting contest and now the series is level! Harry Tector and Curtis Campher were the heroes with the bat, but of course Mark Adair and George Dockrell did their bit at the death in a tense chase. Zimbabwe had to deal with an injury to stand-in captain Sean Williams, with Sikandar Raza already out due to a two-match ban. They missed his overs of spin as Ireland cashed in on Trevor Gwandu. Tector and Campher batted brilliantly to ensure Ireland were always at the right tempo through the chase, despite the early wickets and slow-ish start. For Zimbabwe, the efforts of Madande and Burl with the bat go in vain, but they did really well to take Zimbabwe to 165 after their top order crumbled.

<b>Dockrell hits the winning runs for the second game in a row!</b> Clips a length ball off his hips through midwicket to seal the series with a brace! He falls one short of a half-century but that takes nothing away from a brilliant knock! <b>Ireland have a first away T20I series win against a full member nation!</b>
<b>4.45pm</b> Ireland collect their trophy, one they will remember for a long, long time. They pose with their trophy, get the pictures clicked and will now look to get a bit of a break before the ODI series kicks off on Wednesday. Be sure to join us again then for what should be another exciting series. For now, this is Abhimanyu signing off on behalf of Harshith Gowda. See you, everyone! <b>4.30pm</b> Time for the presentation ceremony! Ireland captain Paul Stirling: "Delighted to get over the line. After losing such a tight game in the first game you can fall apart really quickly but we did well to come back. We've been here for well over a week and after that kind of preparation time you don't have any excuses left. [On the top order not firing] I wouldn't say it's a concern but it's something to think about. It's also a good thing to be still winning games. [On changes for the ODi series] I think we'll have a look and see what we have got depending on the conditions." <b>Craig Young</b> gets an award for the best bowler of the tournament. Unsurprisingly, <b>Harry Tector</b>, the top scorer of the series, gets it for the best batter. And he is named <b>player of the series!</b> Here's what he has to say: "Definitely quite hard to get going today. The way George came in and batted took the pressure off me. Credit has to go to him, he batted so so well. I'm not sure that's the intention all the time, I need to work on it but happy to contribute. [On the pitch] Not too different really, generally the ball stayed low. But a good cricket wicket and plenty in it for bowlers and batters." <b>George Dockrell</b> is the player of the match: "It's always nice when you can chip in on both sides. Had a bit of a bowl in the first game and a bit of a bat in the last two. The pitch has rewarded spinners when they bowled a good length. I'm always happy if the skipper hands me the ball otherwise I'll look to get some runs. [On his partnership with Tector] Look we just wanted to bat 10-12 overs at the time and keep the runs coming and be positive if get balls in good areas." Zimbabwe skipper <b>Ryan Burl</b>: "I think not just today but throughout the series the two quicks have been outstanding and nice to see Brandon Mavuta come out and shine today. [On their total of 140] Certainly not enough on a wicket like this and with a shorter boundary on one side. [On the injuries and suspension to Raza] To be honest I really enjoyed the captaincy but it's not ideal when you have to shuffle like that, especially with three experienced players out. There's been some good performances here and there in patches and going into the longer format we just need to extend those and hopefully we can win it in the longer format." <Hr> Vasumathy : "Blow after blow for Zimbabwe. They lost out on a place in the WT20 earlier and now they have lost the series against an equal strength side (atleast on paper) in familiar home conditions. Sikandar Raza's ban didn't help their cause too. Well done Ireland and lots to ponder for Zimbabwe. " david: "Beating Zimbabwe, after their last series, is a bit like  beating england even the WI can do it!" Well, that's certainly a bit harsh, I would say! <b>4.20pm</b> Harry Tector and George Dockrell's 104-run unbeaten stand has taken Ireland to a memorable series win after being down in the first game in heartbreaking fashion. Tector got the fifty but Dockrell was the real hero of the stand, keeping the tempo up when Zimbabwe's spinners seemed to be on top. Tector then grew into the game and despite being slightly scratchy, hit a well-deserved half-century. Zimbabwe will be upset, but they know that they were stretched really thin, playing their first game without Raza, Ervine and Williams in five years! There were some impressive performances for them, not least of all from Brian Bennett, whose move to No. 3 seemed to give him a chance to grow his confidence after two low scores. Mavuta bowled well, so did Masakadza. And Madande again impressed with the bat, finishing as their highest scorer in the series. However, their top order remains a concern for them. But in the end, it's Ireland with a crucial series win in the bag -- their first away one against a full member country.

Canada win by 12 runs! <b>Their first win in a T20 World Cup!</b> Short of a length outside off, and flung to long-on off the inside half of the bat after skipping down the pitch
It could be over for Ireland already. They have lost twice to start the tournament, and sit at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/points-table-standings">points table</a>. And if they hope to push their case, it will need an encore <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-cup-2006-07-125929/ireland-vs-pakistan-9th-match-group-d-247465/full-scorecard">from 2007</a>. The flip side, though, is that USA and Canada have made this World Cup intriguing enough pretty early. Join us for the action <s>tomorrow morning</s> later today, as New Zealand kick off their campaign. Until then, it is goodnight! NJ Devils: "Group A suddenly becoming Group of Death in two days time :)" <strong>Saad Bin Zafar</strong>: "Very proud moment for me as a team. Ireland bowled well and took three wickets, and put us on the rope. Once we got to 137, we knew it was a good total to defend. We needed a good performance from each and everybody. So proud of each and every bowler that they delivered when it mattered. Wanted to go pace upfront, but I saw that the wicket was a bit slow today... It wasn't easy to get under the ball. It's one game - and one day - at a time, and we're going to come strong against Pakistan as well. It's very important [to get that support]. Cricket is growing in the country." <strong>Paul Stirling</strong>: "Was a tough loss today. It was certainly gettable. We just need to improve all-round. Hopefully we can show a better game. Huge game [coming up] for us." <b>Time for the presentations</b> <strong>Nicholas Kirton is the Player of the Match</strong>: "It's very good to get over the line. I just tried to get in, and tried to get the pace of the wicket. Played a bit up and down, but it was a very good wicket to bat on - to be honest. The partnership with Movva was very important. Hopefully we can go from strength to strength. Our next focus is Pakistan! Better purchase on offer [on the pitch]. We are just taking it one day at a time." Mark: "For Ireland, even beating India and Pakistan may not be enough. They are going to need a big NRR boost too. Canada 'only' need to beat one of the two to be in the mix." Prasanna: "Group A is suddenly looking more competitive and producing interesting games" <strong>1.58pm</strong> Two successive days of an Associate team upsetting a Full Member. Almost a justification that having so many teams in the World Cup is about more than just filling up the spots. Give them a chance at the global stage, and they will show you what they can achieve. Canada come from behind to beat Ireland today, even as they were 54 for 4 after being asked to bat. Kirton and Movva the heroes for Canada, whose bowlers never let Ireland settle even in pursuit of a modest score. The seventh-wicket pair fought for Ireland with a 62-run stand, but by then, it was a little too late.

The Canada dugout and fans can't wait to get going...

Canada win by 12 runs! <b>Their first win in a T20 World Cup!</b> Short of a length outside off, and flung to long-on off the inside half of the bat after skipping down the pitch
It could be over for Ireland already. They have lost twice to start the tournament, and sit at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/points-table-standings">points table</a>. And if they hope to push their case, it will need an encore <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-cup-2006-07-125929/ireland-vs-pakistan-9th-match-group-d-247465/full-scorecard">from 2007</a>. The flip side, though, is that USA and Canada have made this World Cup intriguing enough pretty early. Join us for the action <s>tomorrow morning</s> later today, as New Zealand kick off their campaign. Until then, it is goodnight! NJ Devils: "Group A suddenly becoming Group of Death in two days time :)" <strong>Saad Bin Zafar</strong>: "Very proud moment for me as a team. Ireland bowled well and took three wickets, and put us on the rope. Once we got to 137, we knew it was a good total to defend. We needed a good performance from each and everybody. So proud of each and every bowler that they delivered when it mattered. Wanted to go pace upfront, but I saw that the wicket was a bit slow today... It wasn't easy to get under the ball. It's one game - and one day - at a time, and we're going to come strong against Pakistan as well. It's very important [to get that support]. Cricket is growing in the country." <strong>Paul Stirling</strong>: "Was a tough loss today. It was certainly gettable. We just need to improve all-round. Hopefully we can show a better game. Huge game [coming up] for us." <b>Time for the presentations</b> <strong>Nicholas Kirton is the Player of the Match</strong>: "It's very good to get over the line. I just tried to get in, and tried to get the pace of the wicket. Played a bit up and down, but it was a very good wicket to bat on - to be honest. The partnership with Movva was very important.
