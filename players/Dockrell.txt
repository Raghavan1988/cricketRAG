For Zimbabwe, the efforts of Madande and Burl with the bat go in vain, but they did really well to take Zimbabwe to 165 after their top order crumbled."}]<b>4.50pm</b> So that is all from us today. Join us tomorrow at the same time for the series decider, which, if the first two games are anything to go by, should be a cracking contest. This is Abhimanyu, signing off on behalf of Binoy George and K Vairavan. Ciao, people! <b>4.42pm</b> <b>Time for the presentation ceremony!</b> <b>Harry Tector</b> the player of the match: "Absolutely! It feels like every game against Zimbabwe goes to the last over. [On partnership with Campher] It's certainly a period as a middle order we have spoken about. Happy with how we've done there. Obviously disappointed to get out when I did but happy the lads finished the job. I think the top three we have is world class and they've been doing that for a long time so long may they continue." <b>Paul Stirling</b>: "[On Tector and Campher] That was a real mature partnership by those two batters. Real sign of the maturity they've shown in the last couple of years. [On Ireland's slow start with the bat] I think that's just T20 cricket. Zimbabwe's opening bowlers bowled well. I think there's no real excuse for our fielding not being up to the highest standards. We need to bring it tomorrow." <b>Ryan Burl</b>, standing in for stand-in captain Sean Williams: "Unfortunately one of those things, he's [Williams] got a niggle. Very good start by our guys at a top but unfortunately a cluster of wickets in the middle. We consolidated in the end but we were probably 15-20 runs short. [On Kamunhukamwe] Nice to see him make the most of this opportunity. The boys are always looking to learn and always taking on as much information on board. Unfortunately we didn't put enough runs to defend. [On the Bennett over] One of those things that are high-risk, high reward. <Hr> Don't go anywhere, we will bring you the updates from the post-match presentation soon! Thamizhachi : "If catches win matches, drops lose you matches. Marumani dropped the match for Zimbabwe ! Had he taken the catch , 2 runs would have been stopped, new batter on strike !!! " DaWolf: "Absolutely dropped the match there! Followed by the boundary. Cruel game." <b>4.35pm</b> So, there we have it! Another exciting contest and now the series is level! Harry Tector and Curtis Campher were the heroes with the bat, but of course Mark Adair and George Dockrell did their bit at the death in a tense chase. Zimbabwe had to deal with an injury to stand-in captain Sean Williams, with Sikandar Raza already out due to a two-match ban. They missed his overs of spin as Ireland cashed in on Trevor Gwandu. Tector and Campher batted brilliantly to ensure Ireland were always at the right tempo through the chase, despite the early wickets and slow-ish start. For Zimbabwe, the efforts of Madande and Burl with the bat go in vain, but they did really well to take Zimbabwe to 165 after their top order crumbled.
