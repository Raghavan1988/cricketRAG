Jitesh Sharma comes in now.

Slower through the air on off stump, he defends and gets a thick inside-edge onto his pad
Time for another break Hari: "The difference in batting positions could be the reason why SKY performs better in T20s than ODIs. Also, he likes pace on the ball which is usually something that he doesn't get in ODIs due to spinners operating in tandem." Nikhil : "We sent a young and courageous team to the first T20 WC and hit gold. We need to do the same thing again, let Kohli and Rohit rest. "
