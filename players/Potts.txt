full and sliding leg side as Potts shuffles across and attempts to ramp. Joseph thinks there was something on the ball as it zipped through to Hope, who seems less interested but nevertheless <b>reviews</b> - only for UltraEdge to confirm he missed it by some distance. Not a wide, though, as he had moved into line
Bit of a delay, as Joseph thought he had finished his over and ambled off to fine leg...
