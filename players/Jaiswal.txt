Shankar : "Rain being one concern for this series, more worrying part for SA is their current T20 form with WC within the reach. Given their line-up, surprising to see them losing 4 matches consecutively and given away more than 10 RPO in all of them.. exposing their weak bowling line-up." <strong>4.20pm</strong> A key reason why this series is important for both sides is that they have just five T20Is to nail down their combination for the 2024 T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the USA. So game time is of utmost importance. Of course, there is the SA20 and IPL where a lot of the players will get chances. But nothing like a T20I, isn't it? For fringe players, then, this series presents a massive opportunity. South Africa could have two debutants - both bowlers in left-arm quick Nandre Burger, and right-arm medium-fast Ottniel Baartman - and might give opening batter Matthew Breetzke a run in the remaining two games. India don't have any uncapped players in their touring group, but four of their squad - Mukesh Kumar, Mohammed Siraj, Rinku Singh and Jitesh Sharma - have played 10 T20Is or fewer. Firdose Moonda sets the scene in <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-in-south-africa-2023-24-1387592/south-africa-vs-india-2nd-t20i-1387598/match-preview">the preview</a>. Retief vd Merwe: "Must be funny for India to not see one person in the stands ??? They are use to a crowd of 100 000 people " Not fair to say there is not one person in the stand. The white-ball games, at least, are expected to see packed crowds. It's just the rain has put a dampener on proceedings. <strong>4.05pm</strong> Before anything else, let's discuss the most important point - rain. And unfortunately, the eyes will be on the skies once. At the moment, there is a steady drizzle at the venue, but if the forecast is to be believed, rain should clear in the evening. <strong>4.00pm</strong> Take two! Hello, everyone. Let's start again. Rain played spoilsport in the opening T20I between India and South Africa in Durban without even a ball being bowled. And that leads us to Gqeberha for the second T20I between the two sides. I am Ashish Pant and will soon  be joined by Himanshu Agrawal, as we (hopefully) get the ball rolling on this T20I series.

Official word on Lungi: "Lungi Ngidi has fully recovered from his left lateral ankle sprain but is not match fit." <strong>SA</strong>: 1 Dean Elgar, 2 Aiden Markram, 3 Tony de Zorzi, 4 Temba Bavuma (capt), 5 Keegan Petersen, 6 David Bedingham, 7 Kyle Verreynne (wk), 8 Marco Jansen, 9 Gerald Coetzee, 10 Kagiso Rabada, 11 Nandre Burger <strong>India</strong>: 1 Rohit Sharma (capt), 2 Yashasvi Jaiswal, 3 Shubman Gill, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Shreyas Iyer, 6 KL Rahul (wk), 7 R Ashwin, 8 Shardul Thakur, 9 Jasprit Bumrah, 10 Mohammed Siraj, 11 Prasidh Krishna Jv: "Feel bad for Jaddu but really happy that Ash gets a chance in overseas conditions to again prove why he is the best spinner in the format!!"

James Anderson made his debut before two of the spinners in that attack were born. He has more experience than the rest of the two attacks put together. Shoaib Bashir is set to make debut in the absence of the inured Jack Leach. Their batting remains the same. Who is the debutant Shoaib Bashir? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-vizag-who-is-england-debutant-shoaib-bashir-1419189">This is who</a>. Neal: "Great to see Jimmy Anderson back for England and just ten short of joining two spinners in the 700 test wickets club. At 41, he looks as fit as a fiddle and serves as inspiration to old cricketing codgers around the world ( like me! )." India's XI remains a matter of speculation. Do they go for the aggressive option in Kuldeep Yadav as replacement for Ravindra Jadeja even if it means sacrificing batting depth? Do they stick with two quicks or play Washington Sundar in place of Mohammed Siraj to retain some of the batting depth? Who debuts? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-2nd-test-rajat-patidar-and-sarfaraz-khan-wait-to-wear-the-india-test-cap-1419196">Rajat Patidar or Sarfaraz Khan or both</a>? <strong>8.30am</strong> To get you all ready and worked up for the Test, here is some reading. Firstly the preview by Karthik Krishnaswamy. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-india-2023-24-1389386/india-vs-england-2nd-test-1389400/match-preview">It's happened before, you know?</a> S Rajesh looks at control numbers to attempt to get to the heart of Bazball: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/the-numbers-behind-bazball-how-england-managed-the-risk-reward-equation-in-hyderabad-1418909">make mistakes more often but score more runs between those mistakes</a>. Then we have <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/james-anderson-recalled-for-second-test-with-point-to-prove-1419194">Vish Ehantharajah on James Anderson</a>. And Al Muthu <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-2nd-test-history-weighs-rohit-sharma-down-as-ben-stokes-walks-on-water-1419211">on Rohit Sharma's captaincy</a>. He has already lost as many home Tests as captain as Virat Kohli did through his career, but is it all down to Rohit or a team in transition? <strong>8.20am</strong> Vizag. East coast of India. Temperature in the early 20s. No rain around. Perfect conditions for Test cricket unlike some parts of India that are freezing. And Test cricket that promises to be enthralling after England's shock win last week. Only the fourth Test India have lost at home in more than 11 years. On the three times that it has happened before, India have managed to defend their home turf, but look at the names they are missing: Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, KL Rahul. And yet, you'd think that R Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah should be able to carry India past a team whose attack is a 41-year-old lone seamer and a spin attack with an experience of three Tests between them. Then again it is an attack that conjured a win in a manner nobody envisages a Test win in India. You either hope to bat first on a batting paradise, which changes its nature dramatically when India bat, or you hope to outgun India on a proper bunsen where batting can become a lottery. You don't ever think you'd be able to beat India after a low first-innings score, almost exclusively bowl India out through boundary catches, but then put together a most sensational counterattacking comeback in the second innings. Have England managed to spook India? Can they capitalise on the wear and tear on R Ashwin's body over the course of taking 496 Test wickets? Will India trust their processes to look to respond to Bazball? How good is India's batting going to be in the absence of most names that have carried them over the last decade? It is as good a day as any to start finding out. Toss in 40 minutes.

In men's test match, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/south-africa-in-new-zealand-2023-24-1388186/new-zealand-vs-south-africa-2nd-test-1388222/live-cricket-score">SA is playing exceptionally well against mighty NZ</a> in NZ, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/south-africa-women-in-australia-2023-24-1375859/australia-women-vs-south-africa-women-only-test-1375875/live-cricket-score">Aussie women taking on SA</a> and now inexperienced Indian side taking on Bazball specialist English side!! Good day for test match cricket lovers.." <strong>Ben Stokes, England captain</strong>: We'd have batted too, that's what you do in India. (On 100th Test) Time does fly when you're having fun. Series in nicely balanced, it's a fair reflection of both teams. We're happy with how things have gone. It's been a nice break which helped us refresh. There was no cricket, we got the families out in Dubai. Cricket can be physically and mentally demanding, so it was a great opportunity to get away from cricket and get the feet up. The great thing about Test matches is there are so many moments where things can change and India came out on top. <strong>One change</strong>: Mark Wood comes back for Shoaib Bashir. <strong>Rohit Sharma, India captain</strong>: <strong>We've made four changes</strong>. Some injuries, some guys coming back. <strong>Two debutants: Dhruv Jurel and Sarfaraz Khan</strong>. Siraj and Jadeja are back. Axar and Mukesh miss out. Good pitch, better than the last two ones we played in. We know Rajkot is supposed to be a good pitch, will behave differently as the game goes on. Good toss to win. We played well as a group. Guys stood up when they had to last game. The next three games will be as exciting as the first two. You can't keep the bigger picture in mind. We'll have to keep focus on what we can do here and come out on top. <strong>9am</strong> Toss time. Ravi Shastri is as sprightly as ever. Tails is the call, heads it is. Rohit wins it, India will bat first <strong>Pitch report</strong>: Nick Knight says it looks a fantastic surface. It is two toned. There are wide cracks on the fuller side. The guts of the surface still has cracks but it's smaller. He reckons England going with two seamers is right. The green tinge has gone off. It will dry out. Deep Dasgupta says there's a bit of rough but there won't be much for the spinners in the first two days. Says there is a bit of moisture on the good length for a spinner. Says it's a good batting pitch and the game might go on for 4-5 days. The best time to bat might be days 2 and 3. <strong>8:47pm</strong> The broadcast has begun. <strong>Anil Kumble has handed Sarfaraz Khan his cap</strong>. His parents are emotional on the sidelines. A couple minutes later, <strong>Dhruv Jurel is also shown getting his cap from Dinesh Karthik</strong>. It's a bright morning in Rajkot, the weather is expected to be on the cooler side, as written in the preview. Toss coming up soon, you can follow the action from <strong>Sidharth Monga</strong>'s <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-india-2023-24-1389386/india-vs-england-3rd-test-1389401/live-match-blog">Live Blog</a> too. <strong>Andrew Miller, our UK Editor</strong>, writes about <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ben-stokes-100th-test-england-india-andrew-miller-1421115">Ben Stokes' unbelievable achievements across a storied career so far</a>. Check it out. <strong>Think piece from Sambit Bal, Cricinfo's Editor-in-Chief</strong>: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/how-bazball-alters-one-of-the-fundamental-truths-of-test-cricket-1421029">How Bazball alters one of the fundamental truths of Test cricket</a> John: "If England win the toss, I rate the chances of each team winning about 50/50. If India win the toss, I'd probably give them an 80/20 advantage. The draw would normally be a significant possibility but I'm sure England will be doing all they can to avoid that possibility." Shashikant: "Interesting ! What will be the playing eleven? How the newcomers would contribute? How the pitch plays?And offcourse what would be the result?Thrill begins......." England have announced theirs, they will go into this one with both Anderson and Wood. Their batting remains unchanged. India might have two debutants but we'll know for certain at the toss. The pitch is expected to start flat and get better for spinners over time. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-india-brace-for-amplified-bazball-threat-on-a-possibly-flat-rajkot-pitch-1421121">Karthik Krishnaswamy goes in depth here</a>. Arun Kumar Kark: "Looking forward to seeing Sarfaraz batting.Hardwork should be rewarded." Yes, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-india-2023-24-1389386/india-vs-england-3rd-test-1389401/match-preview">as Alagappan Muthu writes in the match preview</a>, the 26-year-old has worked all his life to become an international cricketer, collecting mind-boggling numbers over the course of recent domestic seasons. <strong>8:30am</strong> And we're off again! It's the third instalment in what is arguably the biggest Test series in terms of length and significance. <strong>It's Ben Stokes' 100th Test</strong> as well, the series in squared at 1-1, the cricket has been top notch and the tactics intriguing. India don't have some of their seniors including Virat Kohli and KL Rahul, England are a new-look outfit but can grow ten-feet tall with the immense confidence they draw from their approach. Another fascinating contest awaits us, hope you're ready for the right. I'm Ekanth and Matt Roller will join here on comms later in the morning.
