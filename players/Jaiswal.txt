So game time is of utmost importance. Of course, there is the SA20 and IPL where a lot of the players will get chances. But nothing like a T20I, isn't it? For fringe players, then, this series presents a massive opportunity. South Africa could have two debutants - both bowlers in left-arm quick Nandre Burger, and right-arm medium-fast Ottniel Baartman - and might give opening batter Matthew Breetzke a run in the remaining two games. India don't have any uncapped players in their touring group, but four of their squad - Mukesh Kumar, Mohammed Siraj, Rinku Singh and Jitesh Sharma - have played 10 T20Is or fewer. Firdose Moonda sets the scene in <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-in-south-africa-2023-24-1387592/south-africa-vs-india-2nd-t20i-1387598/match-preview">the preview</a>. Retief vd Merwe: "Must be funny for India to not see one person in the stands ??? They are use to a crowd of 100 000 people " Not fair to say there is not one person in the stand. The white-ball games, at least, are expected to see packed crowds. It's just the rain has put a dampener on proceedings. <strong>4.05pm</strong> Before anything else, let's discuss the most important point - rain. And unfortunately, the eyes will be on the skies once. At the moment, there is a steady drizzle at the venue, but if the forecast is to be believed, rain should clear in the evening. <strong>4.00pm</strong> Take two! Hello, everyone. Let's start again. Rain played spoilsport in the opening T20I between India and South Africa in Durban without even a ball being bowled. And that leads us to Gqeberha for the second T20I between the two sides. I am Ashish Pant and will soon  be joined by Himanshu Agrawal, as we (hopefully) get the ball rolling on this T20I series.

Time for a "strategy break" Vasumathy : "India are motoring along at almost 10 RPO despite SKY striking at just 110" Srini: "If team India wants to continue with SKY in ODIs too, just don't tell him that they are ODIs....let him of the impression that all the games he is playing are T20Is...then a 30  brisk score always guaranteed"

Ramesh: "Here's hoping Ashwin starts today. Sad to see his spot in the 11 being debated so much. He should make the team sheet in every test, home or abroad." Vinod: "Shardul has 7-fer in SA. Harbajan and Kimble rarely played together in seaming conditions. You have to pick what team wants on given day. Having said that Ashwin could have played in WTC final, I don't see him playing this game in overcast conditions. " <strong>9.12am</strong> Okay, the conditions are not entirely dry. <strong>The toss - and the start - of the Test series opener has been delayed</strong> due to some wet patches on the outfield. There will be an inspection at 10am local time (1.30pm IST).

No slight on Thakur, but Ashwin is an all-time great. The captain needs to trust Ashwin and give him overs. Use him as a pure bowler and not an allrounder, then you'll see him shine. It's okay to go with 3 pacers, as far as I'm concerned. They won't get tired out, if you trust Ashwin and give him overs." Endy: "Two decades back, at the start of any such series in SENA countries, we used to discuss if we were going to draw a Test or if a whitewash would be avoided. Then came Dada's innings <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-tour-of-australia-2003-04-62294/australia-vs-india-1st-test-64059/full-scorecard">in Brisban</a>e - where the ball might hit his body more often than his bat, but what a start to new India in Test cricket. Now, we are discussing if we can win a series in SA. The feeling is incredible." Phani: "Virat as a captain loved fast bowlers. He was an aggressive captain as well overseas, I loved his captaincy. Rohit is seen as innovative captain but these conditions need perseverance, let's see how he goes." Colin: "I think, in the light of all the rain forecast for the next 5 days, that the 2 captains should get together now and each declare their 1st innings closed. At least then there is a chance of a result." --- <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-tour-of-south-africa-1999-00-61687/south-africa-vs-england-5th-test-63864/full-scorecard">The 2000 Test in Centurion</a> was also a one-innings shootout, remember?

His departure marks the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/moonda-dean-elgar-s-retirement-draws-curtains-on-a-certain-era-of-south-african-cricket-1413978">end of an era in SA cricket</a>, as Firdose Moonda puts it. Firdose, who is at SuperSport Park, reports that <strong>both Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi seem good to go</strong>. Ngidi was withdrawn from the T20Is against India with an ankle sprain while Rabada missed a domestic four-day game he was due to play because of a bruised heel. <strong>9.05am</strong> India's training session was called off because of rain on the eve of this Test, but here's some good news from Firdose Moonda: <strong>the conditions in Centurion are dry for now</strong>.
