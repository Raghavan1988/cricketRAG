Out come the two India openers, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill. Jaiswal to take first strike. One wide slip in place. Marco Jansen with the new ball. He is over the wicket. Krishna: "would be interesting to see Kuldeep on these pitches where he had a lot of success in 2018" Ash: "@Vineet J Kuldeep too would have felt the same had he been left out after some fantastic white-ball performances of late!" Graham: "South Africa have four names with 'Z' in them. Has this happened before?" Graham asking the important questions. <strong>4.55pm</strong>: A steady crowd is building up. The white-ball matches should see a good crowd lining up. Time for the national anthems. India's first followed by South Africa's. <strong>Rinku Singh</strong>: "It feels really nice. There is a bouncy wicket here, but it will be nice. Just waiting for the match to start. I like pace and would like to use it. If I am able to use it, it will be good. Will be nice to play this South Africa attack." Vineet J: "Wont do much good to Bishnoi's confidence. Should have been there even at the cost of Kuldeep thats what i feel" <strong>4.45pm</strong> Ruturaj Gaikwad has been left out due to illness. But no Bishnoi and no Shreyas Iyer is surprising. Bishnoi was recently crowned the No.1 T20I bowler in the world and Iyer is coming off a 37-ball 53 against Australia. Tilak Varma is likely to come in at no. 3. For South Africa, there are no major surprises. I was hoping Nandre Burger would get a debut, though. Important toss for South Africa to win. There is likely to be a lot of bounce and movement early on. The surface has been under covers for a while, and the conditions are also overcast. Should be an exciting contest. <strong>4.30pm</strong> Toss: Captain Aiden Markram has the coin. He wins the toss and <strong>South Africa will bowl first.</strong> <b>South Africa: </b> 1 Reeza Hendricks, 2 Matthew Breetzke, 3 Aiden Markram (capt), 4 Heinrich Klaasen (wk), 5 David Miller, 6 Tristan Stubbs, 7 Marco Jansen, 8 Andile Phehlukwayo, 9 Gerald Coetzee, 10 Lizaad Williams, 11 Tabraiz Shamsi <b>India: </b> 1 Yashasvi Jaiswal, 2 Shubman Gill, 3 Tilak Varma, 4 Suryakumar Yadav (capt), 5 Rinku Singh, 6 Jitesh Sharma (wk), 7 Ravindra Jadeja, 8 Arshdeep Singh, 9 Kuldeep Yadav, 10 Mohammed Siraj, 11 Mukesh Kumar <b>Aiden Markram</b>: We are going to have a bowl. [The pitch has] been under covers for most of the day. We'll prefer to chase. Prep has been good, great group, so hope we can get things underway. From out point of view, some of the all-format guys need rest. We have depth around the country, and the guys will come in and hope to perform. No debuts today. <b>Suryakumar Yadav</b>: Very happy to be here. Most importantly, happy to know there is some cricket around. [Batting first] It's completely fine. We were confused about what to do. Very happy to bat first. It's an opportunity for everyone who is playing the game. The World Cup is around 5-6 months away. Have told the boys to enjoy themselves. <strong>4.28pm</strong> The toss is scheduled in a couple of minutes time. By the looks of it, the drizzle seems to have receded. Players are seen doing their pre-game warm-up drills. Here's hoping the weather stays clear for the rest of the day. Mustafa Moudi : "This series is not just good for the preparation of the upcoming T20I World Cup, but also a great chance for the South African players to impress the IPL Teams and attract bids for the IPL 2024 Auction next week !!" <strong>Shubman Gill</strong>: [Series] Very important. There aren't many international T20s before the World Cup. In terms of that very important series. I have played just about 11 T20Is, not many under my belt. I'll be hoping to get some international T20 experience. Just want to be in a good mental space, then it's just about executing the shots, especially in this format. [Pressure] At the end of the day, it's all about bat and ball. It's all about playing for the team. We have such as strong batting lineup, gives freedom for all to play the game. [On the pull shot] I started practicing the shot from the younger days, I started with a plastic ball on a cement pitch. It was my father's idea. Shankar : "Rain being one concern for this series, more worrying part for SA is their current T20 form with WC within the reach. Given their line-up, surprising to see them losing 4 matches consecutively and given away more than 10 RPO in all of them.. exposing their weak bowling line-up." <strong>4.20pm</strong> A key reason why this series is important for both sides is that they have just five T20Is to nail down their combination for the 2024 T20 World Cup in the West Indies and the USA. So game time is of utmost importance. Of course, there is the SA20 and IPL where a lot of the players will get chances. But nothing like a T20I, isn't it? For fringe players, then, this series presents a massive opportunity. South Africa could have two debutants - both bowlers in left-arm quick Nandre Burger, and right-arm medium-fast Ottniel Baartman - and might give opening batter Matthew Breetzke a run in the remaining two games. India don't have any uncapped players in their touring group, but four of their squad - Mukesh Kumar, Mohammed Siraj, Rinku Singh and Jitesh Sharma - have played 10 T20Is or fewer.

Retief vd Merwe: "Must be funny for India to not see one person in the stands ??? They are use to a crowd of 100 000 people " Not fair to say there is not one person in the stand. The white-ball games, at least, are expected to see packed crowds. It's just the rain has put a dampener on proceedings. <strong>4.05pm</strong> Before anything else, let's discuss the most important point - rain. And unfortunately, the eyes will be on the skies once. At the moment, there is a steady drizzle at the venue, but if the forecast is to be believed, rain should clear in the evening. <strong>4.00pm</strong> Take two! Hello, everyone. Let's start again. Rain played spoilsport in the opening T20I between India and South Africa in Durban without even a ball being bowled. And that leads us to Gqeberha for the second T20I between the two sides. I am Ashish Pant and will soon  be joined by Himanshu Agrawal, as we (hopefully) get the ball rolling on this T20I series.

<strong>5.03pm</strong> Nandre Burger has the new ball straightaway. We are running three minutes behind schedule already. Yashasvi Jaiswal on strike.

Chasing is the way to go, Aiden Markram says. Left-arm quick Nandre Burger gets his debut. Keshav Maharaj and Donovan Ferreirs come in too.

Nice even grass. One side of the field is bigger than the other by 10m. Expect a lot of runs, he says. And as Pommie did his match report, Arshdeep Singh marked his run-up. Shark: "Remember India's first ever T20I match played at Johannesburg over 17 years ago (2006) against Graeme Smith's South Africa. India was captained by Sehwag in a world before IPL and before MSD, the captain . Funnily enough I remember India winning that match, thanks to a 21 year old DK, who was the Man of the match then. Quite surreal that he is still technically an active T20I player now (and only one apart from MSD to play competitive cricket) and played the T20I WC as recently as 2022!" <strong>4.15pm</strong> What to expect from the conditions in the Highveld?

<strong>10.30am</strong> Captain Rohit and young Jaiswal will open the batting for the visitors. SA get into a huddle. Rabada is armed with the new ball in conditions that could aid swing and seam. Jaiswal will take first strike for India. He will operate from over the wicket. Let's go <strong>10.16am</strong> <strong>SA win the toss and opt to bowl</strong>. <strong>Jadeja is out with an upper back spasm. Ashwin in</strong>. No Maharaj or Ngidi for SA. Official word on Lungi: "Lungi Ngidi has fully recovered from his left lateral ankle sprain but is not match fit." <strong>SA</strong>: 1 Dean Elgar, 2 Aiden Markram, 3 Tony de Zorzi, 4 Temba Bavuma (capt), 5 Keegan Petersen, 6 David Bedingham, 7 Kyle Verreynne (wk), 8 Marco Jansen, 9 Gerald Coetzee, 10 Kagiso Rabada, 11 Nandre Burger <strong>India</strong>: 1 Rohit Sharma (capt), 2 Yashasvi Jaiswal, 3 Shubman Gill, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Shreyas Iyer, 6 KL Rahul (wk), 7 R Ashwin, 8 Shardul Thakur, 9 Jasprit Bumrah, 10 Mohammed Siraj, 11 Prasidh Krishna Jv: "Feel bad for Jaddu but really happy that Ash gets a chance in overseas conditions to again prove why he is the best spinner in the format!!" Atefi: "Looking forward for an exciting boxing day Test match, Rohit vs Rabada would be fun to watch." <strong>Bavuma</strong>: The wicket has been under covers for the last two days and there is some moisture in the wicket. Guys have gone through their paces. Two debutants: <strong>Burger and Bedingham</strong>. Lungi isn't fully fit yet. We're playing four seamers. <b>Rohit</b>: Honestly, I was not too sure. In times like this, it's better to lose the toss. We are aware of the conditions, the last time around I wasn't here but we had a good result for ourselves. We put runs on the board and the bowlers did the job for us. There is some grass on the pitch and overhead conditions...but guys are accustomed to handle the situation. Ashwin is playing in place of Jadeja - he had a back...neck spasm in the morning. Ashwin will come in handy. Prasidh makes his debut. Shardul, Bumrah and Siraj are the other seamers. Manish : "An anti climax of sorts... Jadeja v Ashwin debate put to rest by a back spasm! " <strong>10.14am</strong> Rohit walks out for the toss and has a chat with coach Dravid. Bavuma also arrives and exchanges team sheets with the India captain. Neal: "Bowl first? Prasadh versus Elgar would be a great way to kick things off. " <strong>10.10am</strong> Here is more from Firdose on the <strong>Centurion conditions</strong>: "The pitch was under cover for around 40 hours and there was extremely heavy rain and so the 'wet patches' have been caused by it sweating." <strong>10am</strong> <strong>Toss will take place at 10.15am. Start at 10.30am.</strong><strong>Bumrah hands Prasidh his maiden Test cap</strong>. It's confirmed. Firdose tells us that Elgar is getting a lot of hugs at the SA team huddle. This is his last Test on his home ground. <strong>9.45am</strong> In case you're just joining us, the toss - and the start - has been delayed due to some wet patches on the outfield. We will have an inspection in about 15 minutes. <strong>Dravid hints that Prasidh Krishna could make his Test debut today</strong>. So, India for the taller, hit-the-deck bowler. This means there could be no room for Mukesh. <strong>Rahul Dravid</strong> (not verbatim): We come close a couple of times and we've played some good cricket here. Maybe a few critical moments...we haven't been able to get over the line. Having said that, we looked at the last series - we bowled well there and we have the ability to take 20 wickets. You need some luck in these conditions as well; there are a lot of plays and misses. You have to ensure you put the ball in right areas and bat with discipline and recognise that you're never in, in these conditions in South Africa. You need to get little things right against a good team like South Africa. <strong>Prasidh is a promising prospect, but we have to be realistic that this is his first Test match</strong>. He hasn't had a lot of first-class cricket to fall back on because of a number of reasons. But I'm hoping he has a good game and enjoys himself. It's such a lovely moment when we give out a new cap to someone. Jigar: "@Mohanty, problem is not that is Jadeja your best spinner? Ash is bit better for sure but Jaddu is not a bowler any team will take him lightly on any wicket and on these bouncy wickets he can be equally lethal.. plus with what Jaddu brings on table as a fielder (remember that smith run out) and as a batter (left hander), he is literally the first name on sheet (ofcourse after captain, Virat and Bumrah)" Who was harder to bowl to - Ponting or Tendulkar? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/you-have-to-answer-who-was-harder-to-bowl-to-ricky-ponting-or-sachin-tendulkar-we-asked-dale-ste-1413816">Dale Steyn answers.</a> Cricket girl: "Playing 2 spinners in SA is madness. I don't think India will play Ashwin here." Mohanty: "Agreed with majority here. Management has to think this way, is Jadeja your best spinner? If no, then just bench him and get in Ash. With both Thakur and Ash, the tail wouldn't look that bad. Besides, with KL keeping, they should be least worried about the batting order." Arvind: "If India wants a 4th pacer, better to go with both Mukesh and Prasidh than to go with Thakur. India's batters are good enough even overseas these days." <strong>9.35am</strong> "I think, to be honest, it's highly frustrating," Vernon Philander says of the delayed start. "But there's been 40 hours of rain up north in Centurion and pitch has been under covers. There are still some wet spots. The sun is peeking in and hopefully we have a restart soon." Ramesh: "Here's hoping Ashwin starts today. Sad to see his spot in the 11 being debated so much. He should make the team sheet in every test, home or abroad." Vinod: "Shardul has 7-fer in SA. Harbajan and Kimble rarely played together in seaming conditions. You have to pick what team wants on given day. Having said that Ashwin could have played in WTC final, I don't see him playing this game in overcast conditions. " <strong>9.12am</strong> Okay, the conditions are not entirely dry. <strong>The toss - and the start - of the Test series opener has been delayed</strong> due to some wet patches on the outfield. There will be an inspection at 10am local time (1.30pm IST).

No slight on Thakur, but Ashwin is an all-time great. The captain needs to trust Ashwin and give him overs. Use him as a pure bowler and not an allrounder, then you'll see him shine. It's okay to go with 3 pacers, as far as I'm concerned. They won't get tired out, if you trust Ashwin and give him overs." Endy: "Two decades back, at the start of any such series in SENA countries, we used to discuss if we were going to draw a Test or if a whitewash would be avoided. Then came Dada's innings <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-tour-of-australia-2003-04-62294/australia-vs-india-1st-test-64059/full-scorecard">in Brisban</a>e - where the ball might hit his body more often than his bat, but what a start to new India in Test cricket. Now, we are discussing if we can win a series in SA. The feeling is incredible." Phani: "Virat as a captain loved fast bowlers. He was an aggressive captain as well overseas, I loved his captaincy. Rohit is seen as innovative captain but these conditions need perseverance, let's see how he goes." Colin: "I think, in the light of all the rain forecast for the next 5 days, that the 2 captains should get together now and each declare their 1st innings closed.

<strong>10.30am</strong> Captain Rohit and young Jaiswal will open the batting for the visitors. SA get into a huddle. Rabada is armed with the new ball in conditions that could aid swing and seam. Jaiswal will take first strike for India. He will operate from over the wicket. Let's go <strong>10.16am</strong> <strong>SA win the toss and opt to bowl</strong>. <strong>Jadeja is out with an upper back spasm. Ashwin in</strong>. No Maharaj or Ngidi for SA. Official word on Lungi: "Lungi Ngidi has fully recovered from his left lateral ankle sprain but is not match fit." <strong>SA</strong>: 1 Dean Elgar, 2 Aiden Markram, 3 Tony de Zorzi, 4 Temba Bavuma (capt), 5 Keegan Petersen, 6 David Bedingham, 7 Kyle Verreynne (wk), 8 Marco Jansen, 9 Gerald Coetzee, 10 Kagiso Rabada, 11 Nandre Burger <strong>India</strong>: 1 Rohit Sharma (capt), 2 Yashasvi Jaiswal, 3 Shubman Gill, 4 Virat Kohli, 5 Shreyas Iyer, 6 KL Rahul (wk), 7 R Ashwin, 8 Shardul Thakur, 9 Jasprit Bumrah, 10 Mohammed Siraj, 11 Prasidh Krishna Jv: "Feel bad for Jaddu but really happy that Ash gets a chance in overseas conditions to again prove why he is the best spinner in the format!!" Atefi: "Looking forward for an exciting boxing day Test match, Rohit vs Rabada would be fun to watch." <strong>Bavuma</strong>: The wicket has been under covers for the last two days and there is some moisture in the wicket. Guys have gone through their paces. Two debutants: <strong>Burger and Bedingham</strong>. Lungi isn't fully fit yet. We're playing four seamers. <b>Rohit</b>: Honestly, I was not too sure. In times like this, it's better to lose the toss. We are aware of the conditions, the last time around I wasn't here but we had a good result for ourselves. We put runs on the board and the bowlers did the job for us. There is some grass on the pitch and overhead conditions...but guys are accustomed to handle the situation. Ashwin is playing in place of Jadeja - he had a back...neck spasm in the morning. Ashwin will come in handy. Prasidh makes his debut. Shardul, Bumrah and Siraj are the other seamers. Manish : "An anti climax of sorts... Jadeja v Ashwin debate put to rest by a back spasm! " <strong>10.14am</strong> Rohit walks out for the toss and has a chat with coach Dravid. Bavuma also arrives and exchanges team sheets with the India captain. Neal: "Bowl first? Prasadh versus Elgar would be a great way to kick things off. " <strong>10.10am</strong> Here is more from Firdose on the <strong>Centurion conditions</strong>: "The pitch was under cover for around 40 hours and there was extremely heavy rain and so the 'wet patches' have been caused by it sweating." <strong>10am</strong> <strong>Toss will take place at 10.15am. Start at 10.30am.</strong><strong>Bumrah hands Prasidh his maiden Test cap</strong>. It's confirmed. Firdose tells us that Elgar is getting a lot of hugs at the SA team huddle. This is his last Test on his home ground. <strong>9.45am</strong> In case you're just joining us, the toss - and the start - has been delayed due to some wet patches on the outfield. We will have an inspection in about 15 minutes. <strong>Dravid hints that Prasidh Krishna could make his Test debut today</strong>. So, India for the taller, hit-the-deck bowler. This means there could be no room for Mukesh. <strong>Rahul Dravid</strong> (not verbatim): We come close a couple of times and we've played some good cricket here. Maybe a few critical moments...we haven't been able to get over the line. Having said that, we looked at the last series - we bowled well there and we have the ability to take 20 wickets. You need some luck in these conditions as well; there are a lot of plays and misses. You have to ensure you put the ball in right areas and bat with discipline and recognise that you're never in, in these conditions in South Africa. You need to get little things right against a good team like South Africa. <strong>Prasidh is a promising prospect, but we have to be realistic that this is his first Test match</strong>. He hasn't had a lot of first-class cricket to fall back on because of a number of reasons. But I'm hoping he has a good game and enjoys himself. It's such a lovely moment when we give out a new cap to someone. Jigar: "@Mohanty, problem is not that is Jadeja your best spinner? Ash is bit better for sure but Jaddu is not a bowler any team will take him lightly on any wicket and on these bouncy wickets he can be equally lethal.. plus with what Jaddu brings on table as a fielder (remember that smith run out) and as a batter (left hander), he is literally the first name on sheet (ofcourse after captain, Virat and Bumrah)" Who was harder to bowl to - Ponting or Tendulkar? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/you-have-to-answer-who-was-harder-to-bowl-to-ricky-ponting-or-sachin-tendulkar-we-asked-dale-ste-1413816">Dale Steyn answers.</a> Cricket girl: "Playing 2 spinners in SA is madness. I don't think India will play Ashwin here." Mohanty: "Agreed with majority here. Management has to think this way, is Jadeja your best spinner? If no, then just bench him and get in Ash. With both Thakur and Ash, the tail wouldn't look that bad. Besides, with KL keeping, they should be least worried about the batting order." Arvind: "If India wants a 4th pacer, better to go with both Mukesh and Prasidh than to go with Thakur. India's batters are good enough even overseas these days." <strong>9.35am</strong> "I think, to be honest, it's highly frustrating," Vernon Philander says of the delayed start. "But there's been 40 hours of rain up north in Centurion and pitch has been under covers. There are still some wet spots. The sun is peeking in and hopefully we have a restart soon." Ramesh: "Here's hoping Ashwin starts today. Sad to see his spot in the 11 being debated so much. He should make the team sheet in every test, home or abroad." Vinod: "Shardul has 7-fer in SA. Harbajan and Kimble rarely played together in seaming conditions. You have to pick what team wants on given day. Having said that Ashwin could have played in WTC final, I don't see him playing this game in overcast conditions. " <strong>9.12am</strong> Okay, the conditions are not entirely dry. <strong>The toss - and the start - of the Test series opener has been delayed</strong> due to some wet patches on the outfield. There will be an inspection at 10am local time (1.30pm IST).

No slight on Thakur, but Ashwin is an all-time great. The captain needs to trust Ashwin and give him overs. Use him as a pure bowler and not an allrounder, then you'll see him shine. It's okay to go with 3 pacers, as far as I'm concerned. They won't get tired out, if you trust Ashwin and give him overs." Endy: "Two decades back, at the start of any such series in SENA countries, we used to discuss if we were going to draw a Test or if a whitewash would be avoided. Then came Dada's innings <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-tour-of-australia-2003-04-62294/australia-vs-india-1st-test-64059/full-scorecard">in Brisban</a>e - where the ball might hit his body more often than his bat, but what a start to new India in Test cricket. Now, we are discussing if we can win a series in SA. The feeling is incredible." Phani: "Virat as a captain loved fast bowlers. He was an aggressive captain as well overseas, I loved his captaincy. Rohit is seen as innovative captain but these conditions need perseverance, let's see how he goes." Colin: "I think, in the light of all the rain forecast for the next 5 days, that the 2 captains should get together now and each declare their 1st innings closed. At least then there is a chance of a result." --- <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-tour-of-south-africa-1999-00-61687/south-africa-vs-england-5th-test-63864/full-scorecard">The 2000 Test in Centurion</a> was also a one-innings shootout, remember?

Sowmya : "Unable to understand whether Stokes is attacking with his spinners or not. By keeping many fielders in the deep, is he encouraging his inexperienced spinners to bowl short?" I guess he's aiming for a balance between close catchers to take wickets and some protection for the bad ball

From myself and Shashank, it's cheerio for now. Bye! <b>4.45pm:</b> Bish, bash, bosh. Baz against Jaz. India in front but England scrapping. No doubt that Yashasvi Jaiswal has been the standout performer, walking off with an unbeaten 76 off 70 - he was principally responsible for the hard time that Tom Hartley had on debut, but England will be encouraged by the chances they created (even while burning through all of their reviews). Plenty of hard yakka to come tomorrow, though, with India out to prove that a Bazball-lite 246 from 64.3 overs was significantly light for a first innings on this pitch The host broadcaster has had a quick word with R Ashwin at the close: "Thought it was pretty interesting [the pitch], maybe a bit of moisture early on. Then I thought it just slowed down. Got to mix your pace up as a bowler. [England score] We thought 240 was competitive, 30-40 more than we would have liked. The start given us by Jaiswal and Rohit made us breathe a little easier. Need someone to go on and score a hundred. [Jaiswal start in Tests] He's not put a foot wrong, playing some great shots.

<strong>9.29am</strong> All in readiness. Test match cricket. James Anderson with the ball. Rohit Sharma and Yashavi Jaiswal to open. Three slips and a gully. Jaiswal will take first strike. <strong>9.25am</strong> Big chance for India to get in a big score on a flat track now that they have won the toss. You can never rule out some new-ball movement, though. And there will be good ole Jimmy Anderson with the new ball. Mustafa Moudi : "3 International Matches (Aus vs WI, Ind Vs Eng and SL vs Afg) beginning one after the other within 30 Minutes gap. Lot of Cricket happening today !!" <strong>9.15am</strong> Here's Sampath Bandarupalli with a great stat: "Test runs by India's playing XI: 10336. Joe Root's Test runs: 11447. This is the first instance in 75 years for India where the combined career Test runs of their playing XI going into a home Test is lower than an opponent player's career tally. There have been four such instances in total before - the first four Test matches played by India at home - between 1933 and 1948." Vin S.: "Another era of Indian test cricket teams is coming to a close, but a new era will dawn again, just like it did after the likes of Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman, Ganguly, Dhoni, Yuvraj, Zaheer, and Kumble hung up their cricket boots. Some very exciting young and talented cricketers are just waiting in the wings for their shot at test cricket." Kiran: "Good call to have 2 fast bowlers. Historically this is a flat pitch and it would have been a struggle to go in with just one pacer" <strong>9.05am</strong> Here are the teams. <strong>India</strong>  YBK Jaiswal, RG Sharma*, Shubman Gill, RM Patidar, SS Iyer, KS Bharat†, R Ashwin, AR Patel, JJ Bumrah, Mukesh Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav <strong>England</strong>  Z Crawley, BM Duckett, OJ Pope, JE Root, JM Bairstow, BA Stokes*, BT Foakes†, Rehan Ahmed, TW Hartley, Shoaib Bashir, JM Anderson <strong>9am</strong> Time for the toss. Rohit Sharma is walking out in his dark blue blazer. Ben Stokes in an identical blue. Tails is the call, but India have won a toss finally. <strong>India will be batting first</strong>. He is talking about the lack of intent in the second innings in Hyderabad. India stick with two pacers, but rest Mohammed Siraj looking at the amount of cricket he has been playing. So <strong>Rajat Patidar, Kuldeep Yadav and Mukesh Kumar come in for KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Siraj</strong>. Siraj has even been released from the squad so that he can spend time at home before he comes back and is available for the third Test. England already announced their XI yesterday. <strong>8.50am</strong> Pitch and conditions then. It is a flat pitch. "like the road out there," says Kevin Pietersen. "If England win the toss there, they will score millions." "Absolute beauty to bat on," says Eoin Morgan. Dinesh Karthik says there will be turn but not on the first two days. It only makes the toss more crucial. Karthik also informs that the top layer is black soil but the core is red. <strong>8.45am</strong> Rajat Patidar has received his cap. Handed to him by Zaheer Khan. A rare debutant for India after the age of 30. Tells you there has been a strong era around him. He comes in with a first-class average of 46. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/how-rajat-patidar-earned-his-selection-to-indias-test-squad-1417938">Shashank Kishore has more on Patidar</a>. <strong>8.40am</strong> England named their XI a day before the Test. James Anderson made his debut before two of the spinners in that attack were born. He has more experience than the rest of the two attacks put together. Shoaib Bashir is set to make debut in the absence of the inured Jack Leach. Their batting remains the same. Who is the debutant Shoaib Bashir? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-vizag-who-is-england-debutant-shoaib-bashir-1419189">This is who</a>. Neal: "Great to see Jimmy Anderson back for England and just ten short of joining two spinners in the 700 test wickets club. At 41, he looks as fit as a fiddle and serves as inspiration to old cricketing codgers around the world ( like me! )." India's XI remains a matter of speculation. Do they go for the aggressive option in Kuldeep Yadav as replacement for Ravindra Jadeja even if it means sacrificing batting depth? Do they stick with two quicks or play Washington Sundar in place of Mohammed Siraj to retain some of the batting depth? Who debuts? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-2nd-test-rajat-patidar-and-sarfaraz-khan-wait-to-wear-the-india-test-cap-1419196">Rajat Patidar or Sarfaraz Khan or both</a>? <strong>8.30am</strong> To get you all ready and worked up for the Test, here is some reading. Firstly the preview by Karthik Krishnaswamy. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-india-2023-24-1389386/india-vs-england-2nd-test-1389400/match-preview">It's happened before, you know?</a> S Rajesh looks at control numbers to attempt to get to the heart of Bazball: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/the-numbers-behind-bazball-how-england-managed-the-risk-reward-equation-in-hyderabad-1418909">make mistakes more often but score more runs between those mistakes</a>.

He has already lost as many home Tests as captain as Virat Kohli did through his career, but is it all down to Rohit or a team in transition? <strong>8.20am</strong> Vizag. East coast of India. Temperature in the early 20s. No rain around. Perfect conditions for Test cricket unlike some parts of India that are freezing. And Test cricket that promises to be enthralling after England's shock win last week. Only the fourth Test India have lost at home in more than 11 years. On the three times that it has happened before, India have managed to defend their home turf, but look at the names they are missing: Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, KL Rahul. And yet, you'd think that R Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah should be able to carry India past a team whose attack is a 41-year-old lone seamer and a spin attack with an experience of three Tests between them. Then again it is an attack that conjured a win in a manner nobody envisages a Test win in India. You either hope to bat first on a batting paradise, which changes its nature dramatically when India bat, or you hope to outgun India on a proper bunsen where batting can become a lottery. You don't ever think you'd be able to beat India after a low first-innings score, almost exclusively bowl India out through boundary catches, but then put together a most sensational counterattacking comeback in the second innings. Have England managed to spook India? Can they capitalise on the wear and tear on R Ashwin's body over the course of taking 496 Test wickets? Will India trust their processes to look to respond to Bazball? How good is India's batting going to be in the absence of most names that have carried them over the last decade? It is as good a day as any to start finding out. Toss in 40 minutes.

<strong>9.29am</strong> All in readiness. Test match cricket. James Anderson with the ball. Rohit Sharma and Yashavi Jaiswal to open. Three slips and a gully. Jaiswal will take first strike. <strong>9.25am</strong> Big chance for India to get in a big score on a flat track now that they have won the toss. You can never rule out some new-ball movement, though. And there will be good ole Jimmy Anderson with the new ball. Mustafa Moudi : "3 International Matches (Aus vs WI, Ind Vs Eng and SL vs Afg) beginning one after the other within 30 Minutes gap. Lot of Cricket happening today !!" <strong>9.15am</strong> Here's Sampath Bandarupalli with a great stat: "Test runs by India's playing XI: 10336. Joe Root's Test runs: 11447. This is the first instance in 75 years for India where the combined career Test runs of their playing XI going into a home Test is lower than an opponent player's career tally. There have been four such instances in total before - the first four Test matches played by India at home - between 1933 and 1948." Vin S.: "Another era of Indian test cricket teams is coming to a close, but a new era will dawn again, just like it did after the likes of Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman, Ganguly, Dhoni, Yuvraj, Zaheer, and Kumble hung up their cricket boots. Some very exciting young and talented cricketers are just waiting in the wings for their shot at test cricket." Kiran: "Good call to have 2 fast bowlers. Historically this is a flat pitch and it would have been a struggle to go in with just one pacer" <strong>9.05am</strong> Here are the teams. <strong>India</strong>  YBK Jaiswal, RG Sharma*, Shubman Gill, RM Patidar, SS Iyer, KS Bharat†, R Ashwin, AR Patel, JJ Bumrah, Mukesh Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav <strong>England</strong>  Z Crawley, BM Duckett, OJ Pope, JE Root, JM Bairstow, BA Stokes*, BT Foakes†, Rehan Ahmed, TW Hartley, Shoaib Bashir, JM Anderson <strong>9am</strong> Time for the toss. Rohit Sharma is walking out in his dark blue blazer. Ben Stokes in an identical blue. Tails is the call, but India have won a toss finally. <strong>India will be batting first</strong>. He is talking about the lack of intent in the second innings in Hyderabad. India stick with two pacers, but rest Mohammed Siraj looking at the amount of cricket he has been playing. So <strong>Rajat Patidar, Kuldeep Yadav and Mukesh Kumar come in for KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja and Siraj</strong>. Siraj has even been released from the squad so that he can spend time at home before he comes back and is available for the third Test. England already announced their XI yesterday. <strong>8.50am</strong> Pitch and conditions then. It is a flat pitch. "like the road out there," says Kevin Pietersen. "If England win the toss there, they will score millions." "Absolute beauty to bat on," says Eoin Morgan. Dinesh Karthik says there will be turn but not on the first two days. It only makes the toss more crucial. Karthik also informs that the top layer is black soil but the core is red. <strong>8.45am</strong> Rajat Patidar has received his cap. Handed to him by Zaheer Khan. A rare debutant for India after the age of 30. Tells you there has been a strong era around him. He comes in with a first-class average of 46. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/how-rajat-patidar-earned-his-selection-to-indias-test-squad-1417938">Shashank Kishore has more on Patidar</a>. <strong>8.40am</strong> England named their XI a day before the Test. James Anderson made his debut before two of the spinners in that attack were born. He has more experience than the rest of the two attacks put together. Shoaib Bashir is set to make debut in the absence of the inured Jack Leach. Their batting remains the same. Who is the debutant Shoaib Bashir? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-vizag-who-is-england-debutant-shoaib-bashir-1419189">This is who</a>. Neal: "Great to see Jimmy Anderson back for England and just ten short of joining two spinners in the 700 test wickets club. At 41, he looks as fit as a fiddle and serves as inspiration to old cricketing codgers around the world ( like me! )." India's XI remains a matter of speculation. Do they go for the aggressive option in Kuldeep Yadav as replacement for Ravindra Jadeja even if it means sacrificing batting depth? Do they stick with two quicks or play Washington Sundar in place of Mohammed Siraj to retain some of the batting depth? Who debuts? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-eng-2nd-test-rajat-patidar-and-sarfaraz-khan-wait-to-wear-the-india-test-cap-1419196">Rajat Patidar or Sarfaraz Khan or both</a>? <strong>8.30am</strong> To get you all ready and worked up for the Test, here is some reading. Firstly the preview by Karthik Krishnaswamy. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-india-2023-24-1389386/india-vs-england-2nd-test-1389400/match-preview">It's happened before, you know?</a> S Rajesh looks at control numbers to attempt to get to the heart of Bazball: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/the-numbers-behind-bazball-how-england-managed-the-risk-reward-equation-in-hyderabad-1418909">make mistakes more often but score more runs between those mistakes</a>.

He has already lost as many home Tests as captain as Virat Kohli did through his career, but is it all down to Rohit or a team in transition? <strong>8.20am</strong> Vizag. East coast of India. Temperature in the early 20s. No rain around. Perfect conditions for Test cricket unlike some parts of India that are freezing. And Test cricket that promises to be enthralling after England's shock win last week. Only the fourth Test India have lost at home in more than 11 years. On the three times that it has happened before, India have managed to defend their home turf, but look at the names they are missing: Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, KL Rahul. And yet, you'd think that R Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah should be able to carry India past a team whose attack is a 41-year-old lone seamer and a spin attack with an experience of three Tests between them. Then again it is an attack that conjured a win in a manner nobody envisages a Test win in India. You either hope to bat first on a batting paradise, which changes its nature dramatically when India bat, or you hope to outgun India on a proper bunsen where batting can become a lottery. You don't ever think you'd be able to beat India after a low first-innings score, almost exclusively bowl India out through boundary catches, but then put together a most sensational counterattacking comeback in the second innings. Have England managed to spook India? Can they capitalise on the wear and tear on R Ashwin's body over the course of taking 496 Test wickets? Will India trust their processes to look to respond to Bazball? How good is India's batting going to be in the absence of most names that have carried them over the last decade? It is as good a day as any to start finding out. Toss in 40 minutes.

Root, Crawley and Bairstow are the slips. Duckett at gully. "Controversial view probably. But I think Australia under Steve Waugh played more aggressive cricket than Bazball. They scored at 1 - 1.5 RPO over the other teams and set very aggressive fields. Today, Bazball seems to be focused on aggressive batting but England have a fairly standard approach to bowling.

<B>11.30am</B> Well, that was a fascinating session. England added 51 runs with barely a flicker of alarm in the first hour, but after shipping their last three wickets for six runs to leave Joe Root unbeaten on 122, England have struck early through James Anderson to extract the captain Rohit Sharma. But Gill and, especially, Jaiswal are settling into their work on a pitch that still isn't revealing many demons. Certainly fewer than we were anticipating after the dramas of the first morning. It's going to be a tough afternoon for the bowlers, you sense, but runs on the board still count for plenty at this stage. Monga will be back in the hot seat shortly. NewGuy: "I think Robinson has already played a match winning hand. Anything he does on top of that is bonus" Interesting. His maiden Test half-century was a crucial performance, coaxed an extra 100 runs out of England's innings. Meanwhile in hockey, Janneke Schopman resigned from her post as the Indian women's hockey team's coach last evening.

<strong>2.32pm</strong> Bashir continues into his 16th over. All in one unbroken spell. Around the wicket with one slip in place <strong>2.30pm</strong> What a spell for Bashir. He bowled unchanged through that session. He has figures of 15-2-32-3. I wonder how well the light will hold up. The sun has been behind the clouds pretty much through the day. We are in the eastern parts of India so light fades quickly anyway. I heard Sarfaraz say he didn't see the last ball before tea. The flood lights were just about taking effect then. Let's see how the visibility is. Anyway it won't depend on Sarfaraz or Stokes. The umpires make an independent decision on light these days. Thirty-five overs remain in the day. I don't think we will get them all in. <strong>2.25pm</strong> Well, well, well. What do we got over here? The pitch is beginning to play tricks. And if it is playing tricks in the second innings, what knows what will happen in the fourth? So India need to score most of their runs in this innings, but England have a 223-run lead right now. That is the dressing room to be in for now. What can Jaiswal and Sarfaraz do?

<strong>2.32pm</strong> Bashir continues into his 16th over. All in one unbroken spell. Around the wicket with one slip in place <strong>2.30pm</strong> What a spell for Bashir. He bowled unchanged through that session. He has figures of 15-2-32-3. I wonder how well the light will hold up. The sun has been behind the clouds pretty much through the day. We are in the eastern parts of India so light fades quickly anyway. I heard Sarfaraz say he didn't see the last ball before tea. The flood lights were just about taking effect then. Let's see how the visibility is. Anyway it won't depend on Sarfaraz or Stokes. The umpires make an independent decision on light these days. Thirty-five overs remain in the day. I don't think we will get them all in. <strong>2.25pm</strong> Well, well, well. What do we got over here? The pitch is beginning to play tricks.
