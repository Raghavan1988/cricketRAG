<strong>Marco Jansen uses his wingspan brilliantly, takes a stunning one-hander at first slip</strong>. He was diving to the left but was a bit late on the ball, nonetheless he went down like a lanky Ozymandias, and the ball stuck. He might've even started looking to take it with both hands but reflexes took over. Was a length ball outside off that swung away, O'Dowd tried cutting it but got an edge that took the ball flat and low.

Nails the drive on the up, fielder at cover is on the wrong direction but sticks his hand out and the ball does the same
