O'Dowd is OUT! caught
c & b Tanzim Hasan Sakib
Max O'Dowd c & b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 12 (16b 3x4 0x6 23m) SR: 75
<strong>Excellent catch by Tanzim in the follow-through</strong>. He delivered the cutter into the pitch and was falling away to the left. O'Dowd made room and tried to flat-bat it as hard as possible but got it high off the bat. The visuals almost looked incongruous as the contact was high up off the bat. So, the pace wasn't at its peak and Tanzim stuck out his hand to the left and took it close to the body

<strong>Awesome cover drive on the up</strong>. Fullish length but not far from length, 140ks, fifth-stump line. O'Dowd stood upright and creamed it through the line and along the ground

A bit of drizzle but bright sunshine too

Taps it late, almost too much as the ball rolls back. One bounce and goes through the fifth-stump line. Was a length ball he played with an angled bat

O' Dowd tries the flick and he's gone! This was another slower one, I think, on about middle stump. Having seen Levitt hit a couple of boundaries with that pick-up shot, O'Dowd ventures one of his own, but he doesn't connect well, partly because of the pace. Kamindu Mendis on that deep square leg boundary , and barely has to move
