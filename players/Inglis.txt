Was a loopy full ball at 83ks, Inglis went for the hard reverse, the bat jammed into the ground after missing the ball and it then ballooned off the glove. Motie bowled that real slow and was angling it just down leg.

Hello, again, everyone. Thanks, Alex. Ferguson is back into the attack
Inglis is OUT! caught
c Chapman b Ferguson
Josh Inglis c Chapman b Ferguson 5 (3b 1x4 0x6 7m) SR: 166.66
...and he bounces Inglis out! Chapman hangs onto this. Chest-high short ball, angling into the body, Ferguson has Inglis splicing the pull. Chapman runs across to his right from deep square leg and settles under this coolly. No mistake from Chapman this time around
