Another variation into the pitch, spits up at Smit who manages to get it away to square leg. The first single is comfortable enough for the pair to consider a sceond, but a tartan shirt is quick on the scene and puts them off

Similar delivery, dug out to long on. Comfortable single.... hold up, Smit wants two... <strong>and now he's decided against it and Wheal has the bails are off!</strong> The intention was sound, but that was poor

<strong>And Smit starts with a biggie!</strong> Pits the length ball, holds his shape and launches it over straight midwicket. Helped by the breeze, but it was a well-judged and well-executed shot

JJ Smit lbw b Ellis 3 (9b 0x4 0x6 15m) SR: 33.33
<strong>huge appeal, not given!</strong> Back of a length on middle and off. Jags back sharply and cuts Smit in half. He seems to play all around it and gets rapped on the back leg. Australia discuss and then decide to go upstairs. Did Smit hit it? Looked a touch high too. <strong>Okay, so there is no bat involved. The ball did strike Smit on the flap of the back pad, though. All eyes on Ball Tracking now, and it shows the ball would have smashed into the top of leg stump. The decision to review vindicated, and Namibia are four down now!</strong>
