Without his 33, South Africa were going to be all out for a third-straight double-digit total against India in ODIs. BeardGuy: "The arrival of Marco Jansen made everyone forget how good an all-rounder Andile Pehlukwayo really is. He plays an unsexy utility role that never gets noticed. He bowls cutters in the middle overs, he can handle an additional over or two in the death because the captain already spent the strike bowler's quota at the start of the innings, and with the bat in ODIs he's a budget Dhoni. It's a pity that his best format is also the one that's most at risk of dying." <B>JUST IN from the BCCI:</b> Mr Ishan Kishan has requested the BCCI to be released from the upcoming Test series against South Africa citing personal reasons. The wicket-keeper has subsequently been withdrawn from the Test squad.
