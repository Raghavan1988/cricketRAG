Driven down the ground, they scamper back before the throw from long-off comes through. Movva's charge gives Canada a 21-run over to finish off the innings
USA will need to complete their highest successful chase in T20Is to win the opener. Can they do it? Find out with Sreshth. Sohum T: "Please do speak about what is a par-score on this pitch." As Dhaliwal said, this is up there. But the pitch is excellent and the outfield too. If the new ball swings under lights, that could be significant. Kieran: "Watching from Toronto. That was impressive by Canada! Come on boys, let's win this!" Amit: "Very strong score by Canadian team. First match in world cup, however they have played very good cricketing shots. Pakistan and Indian team should watch this. Need to wait to see how USA reply. If they give tough fight, India and Pak have to put good efforts in group stage." <strong>Navneet Dhaliwal</strong>: Good wicket to bat on, very happy. It is a high-profile game, but we are used to pressure games vs USA. (On Aaron Johnson) First few balls, there are nerves but he always gets a good start which helps. 180-185 is par, we finished well but we have to bowl well. We have to bowl normal good areas, change of pace will help. <strong>9:13pm</strong> Canada have won the front and back ends of the innings. They were proactive from the start, Johnson and Dhaliwal got boundaries in the powerplay on a pitch that offered even pace and bounce. Their 43-run stand got Canada going but USA managed to slow things down with Harmeet's spin. Kirton taking off, however, kept them ticking along. He stitched a 62-run stand with Dhaliwal, who finished with 61, and then accelerated with Movva. Jasdeep, Anderson and Ali started to slow things down towards the end but Bajwa and Movva charged in the final two overs to carry Canada to 194. Canada's 194/5 is now the highest total by an associate team at the men's T20 World Cup, surpassing 193/4 by Netherlands vs Ireland in 2014.

Movva is run-out attempting a second! They had to go for the run, with nothing to lose, though. Adair had mid-off back on the boundary for this ball, and again went for a slower delivery on a full length around off. Movva opened the face of the to loft, and got it aerially towards long-off, who raced forward to collect and throw the ball at the striker's end
<strong>Nicholas Kirton</strong>: "The pitch was a bit up and down, but the ball was coming through okay. I think we have a defendable score. When the innings had started we had thought of getting 130-140, so anything above is a bonus." Chowdary: "@Robbie, "Movva" is a Telugu name, it's name of a village in Andhra, India." --- Movving over from Canada to India... Zack Skewz: "Movva and a Shaker?" --- Keep Movving with those suggestions, guys! <strong>12.09pm</strong> Canada recover from 54 for 4 to post 137, by far the highest score at his ground in this tournament. Kirton and Movva added 75 for the fifth wicket on what seemed like a much better pitch, where batters weren't getting hit by the steep bounce. There was the odd occasion of extra bounce and the ball zipping through off the surface, but that was it. That helped Kirton lead Canada's charge with 49 when Ireland must have thought of restricting them to below hundred. Meanwhile, both teams remain winless so far, so join Ashish for the chase soon.
