Drinks taken. Well, thinks are looking very bleak for USA. Having to play today without the new ball pace combo of Netravalkar and Ali Khan who are both back at the hotel dealing with illness, they opened with spin from one end and barring a few deliveries from Paradkar's left-arm pace at the opposite end, never really threatened to take a wicket during a half-century opening stand that was broken by Jessy Singh coming on at first change. Sean Williams is looking awfully comfortable against USA's spin heavy attack. Already four spin options have been used so far. As long as Williams is there, Zimbabwe look set to post 300+.

<b>The Williams epic comes to an end!</b> Length ball on eighth stump, slaps this with a flat bat to Kenjiige kneeling three yards inside the rope at long-off who takes this coolly. Paradkar breathes a sigh of relief. Williams was running out of steam during the last 10 overs or so cramping up. He ends with a career-best, and then some, helping his side set numerous records today.

tries a reverse-sweep, another appeal for lbw, not given, but this time we have a DRS review. It has hit him in the rib cage but has kissed the thigh pad on the way so there is a chance this might be hitting. Height seems the only issue here. And the replay shows it is hitting off. There hasn't been a great amount of bounce in this pitch. India one wicket away now

Oh no, Williams what have you done?! The captain has skied a catch to Balbirnie at backward point, who would not have taken too many easier grabs in his life. Campher goes for a slower bouncer and Williams wants to swat it away. The lack of pace does him in, though. Good comeback from Campher after conceding 12 runs off the first three balls!

Oh no, Williams what have you done?! The captain has skied a catch to Balbirnie at backward point, who would not have taken too many easier grabs in his life. Campher goes for a slower bouncer and Williams wants to swat it away. The lack of pace does him in, though. Good comeback from Campher after conceding 12 runs off the first three balls!
