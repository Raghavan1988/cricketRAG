Short of a length wide outside off, Harmeet Singh smacks it aerially over the extra cover fielder and picks up a boundary, finishes the game in style!
In the three-match series versus Bangladesh, the USA leads 1-0. That's all we have to add at this moment. We truly value your presence with us. Be sure to attend the Second T20I of the series on May 23 at the same time at Prairie View, Houston. Here's Rashad saying farewell on behalf of Ranjith, Thilak, and the entire team till then. Good night and bye. <strong>Player of the Match Harmeet Singh:</strong>  "I think it's a great feeling (Winning the match). It's a home ground and first game is always advantage for us. Our team backed up ourselves and took that advantage, and surely we did not give Bangladesh the feeling that they would walk over us. I think the way cricket is going nowadays, 12 an over is still in reach. I backed myself, if I give myself a couple of balls, even if it is 13 an over with Corey on the other side. They were a bowler short in the end. So my calculation was someone has to bowl the last one. If you stay in the hunt till the last over, I was backing myself and the main aspect of the game was to stay in the game till the last. It came down to our best efforts in the last over and I think that was our plan. (On Corey Anderson) Definitely Corey brings a lot of experience. He himself played a lot of world cups and a lot of big tournaments, big games. He knows how to finish games and how to stay calm under pressure, finish till the last ball. I think his appearance benefits the team a lot, we all look up to him!" <strong>Monank Patel: </strong> "I am really happy the way we played actually, winning the toss and bowling first. Credit goes to our spinners, the way they utilized the condition and bowled at the right areas. The bowling unit gave us crucial wickets. The way they bowled against the left and right combination (Bangladeshi Batters) throughout the 20 overs, we managed it well. (Batting unit) I think the way we started we were in the game. Lost few wickets in the middle and that's an area we need to improve. The way Harmeet and Corey finished the game, all credit to them. We want to carry all the positives from today and make sure the mistakes made today won't be repeated in the next few games." <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto: </strong> "We didn't bat well. We started well in the beginning but in the middle we lost couple of wickets, so I think if we can score more 20 runs then it would be a decent total. (Batters struggling) I don't think its wrong with the instincts. We did not play on a good wicket even in the Zimbabwe series so batsman are really struggling. But it's all mentality things so I really hope the batsman will come back in form. Our spinners bowled really well. In the last 2-3 overs our seamers did not execute their plan. So I hope in the next matches they will come back." <strong>Presentation Ceremony: </strong> Pradipta : "Big day for US team! Feeling very proud. Can't stop following the game from NJ while attending daughter's graduation ceremony. Hope to see more such performances in future!" <strong>Today at the Prairie View in Houston, history has been made!</strong> What a day for cricket lovers in the USA! In the first game of the three-match series, USA defeated Bangladesh by 5 wickets, pulling off the biggest upset in their history of cricket. The dot balls were stacking up for the USA batsmen in the middle, and Bangladesh was well on its way to win. However, Corey Anderson and Harmeet Singh had other ideas. Corey scored 34 runs off 24 balls, and Harmeet Singh scored 33 runs off 13 balls. In T20I cricket, the two hitters scored 62 runs to establish the highest sixth wicket partnership for the USA. Shakib and Mahedi bowled reasonably well, while the other bowlers were quite expensive. The bowlers gave away 12 extras including 7 wides. Most of the times, the USA batters capitalized on the extra deliveries bowled. <strong>U.S.A won the match by 5 wickets</strong>
