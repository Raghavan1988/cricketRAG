<strong>10:18pm</strong> Sherfane Rutherford. That was what this innings was all about. He walked in when the West Indies were in strife. A few overs later, they were staring down the barrel but Rutherford kept calm. He milked the singles initially, chose his moments to attack and then unleashed at the end, ensuring the West Indies made 58 in their last five. He also stitched together a 37-run last-wicket stand, with every run coming off Rutherford's bat. New Zealand will feel they missed an opportunity to bundle the two-time champions out for a paltry total. They had them 76-7 at one stage but could not quite capitalise. Williamson's usage of his bowlers also left a bit to be desired and they ended up bowling Mitchell in the 19th and Santner (a left-arm spinner) against Rutherford in the 20th. Prior to that, the old guard, comprising Boult, Ferguson and Southee were exceptional. Boult was probably the pick of the bunch, scalping three vital wickets, including that of Russell. Neesham did his bit too, with the fifth bowler quota being the only dull spot in what was otherwise an accomplished bowling display. 149, viewed in isolation, may not seem much, but on this track, which has variable bounce and is pretty two-paced, could be a very good total. NZ will also have to dispel the doubts that shrouded their performance the other day and how they do that could be key in this run-chase. Join us in a bit. <b>Sherfane Rutherford:</b> It was a good innings. Playing a World Cup match is a dream and that is what we live for. Happy to contribute. Very tough surface to bat on. My plan was to bat deep. I was just telling the bowlers that even if we just get singles now, it all adds up. 149 is a brilliant score on this wicket.
