Brian Bennett c Tector b Young 1 (4b 0x4 0x6 9m) SR: 25
<strong>Stunning catch from Tector!</strong> He backpedals from mid-off, towards his left. Has his eyes on the ball always. Stretches out his right arm just in time, times his leap well and holds on with the dive. He celebrates with a roar. This was meant to be hit - full around off and angling in. Bennett made room and took the aerial route and almost got the result he wanted but for a flying human

Join us for the run chase after a short break. <strong>Jonathan Campbell at the innings break: </strong> "It is good to be in international cricket. We needed to get to a good score. We tried to play as fearlessly as possible. We (Bennett and I) are good mates. We shared a room in the past. We really enjoyed ourselves. They bowled well, but it is a good batting wicket. We have to bowl well." Once again, Bangladesh bowled brilliantly throughout the powerplay, their consistent, disciplined line and length failing miserably to allow Zimbabwe's top order to play freely. Then Campbell, making his debut, and Bennett began to rotate the strike and play explosive shots, combining for a partnership of 73 runs (43 runs). Jaker dropped Bennet early, which cost them dearly in the long run.  Mahedi, Taskin, and Shoriful were the most economical bowlers, all of them claimed wickets. Rishad and Saifuddin were the expensive ones. <strong>Bangladesh requires 139 runs to win the match</strong>
