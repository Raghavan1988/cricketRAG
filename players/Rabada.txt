<strong>great catch!</strong> Maxwell at long-on finishes things off. Rabada connect well with his drive down the ground, but Maxwell went low to his right and held it very well
<b>6.15pm</b> South Africa get to 212 (one short of the 213 of the 1999 semi-final, for those of you who like that stuff). It's more than looked likely in the first 10 overs, and it's largely thanks to one man - David Miller with a fantastic century. The pitch has a bit in it for all bowlers, but still hard to see it being enough. Australia were, largely, outstanding with the ball. Only Adam Zampa struggled. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood set the tone while Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head played a big role. South Africa have two frontline spinners plus Aiden Markram, so keep an eye on them. Alan will be with you for the start of the chase. The weather looks fine at the moment.

Is it the pitch, Siraj or SA considering this as world cup, the issue? or combination of all." --- It's not an unplayable pitch. Definitely not a 55 all-out one. There has been movement on offer but the credit goes to the Indian bowlers as well for bowling the right lengths and the fielders to take every catch that came their way. <b>12.02pm</b> What a first session we have had. South Africa won the toss but it all went downhill from their onwards. Siraj was on a roll, bowling nine overs on the trot and picking up 6 for 15.

Sandeep Lamichhane might have been the headliner coming into this, but it was the supporting acts of Kushal Bhurtel (4 for 19) and Dipendra Airee (3 for 21) that did the damage. The wicket itself became slower as the innings progressed, aiding the spinners significantly. As such the South African batters struggled to really get going, with only Reeza Hendricks (43 off 49) and Tristan Stubbs (27 off 18) contributing anything of note.
