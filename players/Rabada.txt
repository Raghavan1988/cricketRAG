This is South Africa's <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/team/team-lowest-innings-totals/south-africa-3/test-matches-1\">lowest total since 1932</a>, and the lowest by any team <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/opposition/team-lowest-innings-totals/india-6/test-matches-1\">against India</a>."}]Meanwhile, the Ranji Trophy begins on January 5 and Devdutt Padikkal, the Karnataka batter, is looking to carry forward his impressive white-ball form. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ranji-trophy-2023-24-devdutt-padikkal-looks-to-bounce-back-by-staying-stable-through-the-highs-and-lows-1415328">He spoke very candidly with Shashank Kishore</a> on the IPL trade, his challenges, an illness that hampered his previous season and much more. We will be back in a bit. Stay tuned. Mohan : "Mukesh Kumar exhibited great control over line and length, he bowled as if he were playing on home ground. Mukesh should be the change bowler, not Prasidh from now on." Mazher: "Why no comment so far on the pitch. No pitch report either to judge why would SA decide to bat first. Is it the pitch, Siraj or SA considering this as world cup, the issue? or combination of all." --- It's not an unplayable pitch. Definitely not a 55 all-out one. There has been movement on offer but the credit goes to the Indian bowlers as well for bowling the right lengths and the fielders to take every catch that came their way. <b>12.02pm</b> What a first session we have had. South Africa won the toss but it all went downhill from their onwards. Siraj was on a roll, bowling nine overs on the trot and picking up 6 for 15. He has had similar spells in ODIs as well recently, but this one reminded me of one of those Stuart Broad spells. This is South Africa's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/team/team-lowest-innings-totals/south-africa-3/test-matches-1">lowest total since 1932</a>, and the lowest by any team <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/opposition/team-lowest-innings-totals/india-6/test-matches-1">against India</a>.
