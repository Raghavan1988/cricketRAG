<b>8.35pm</b> An innings of ebbs and flows. Gurbaz started aggressively before Naib took over. Axar and Dube struck in successive overs but Naib kept going and brought up his fifty off just 28 balls. But once Axar got it him out, the upcoming batters struggled a bit. Then, towards the end, Janat and Mujeeb combined for 41 off just 19 to take Afghanistan to 172. But will it be enough? Himanshu will be here soon to find out with you guys. Stay tuned.

c Delany b McCarthy
Naveen-ul-Haq c Delany b McCarthy 13 (15b 1x4 1x6 22m) SR: 86.66
taken at deep backward point! Naveen looked to slice it stylishly with a full swing of the arms, but fell this time. The ball flew off the outside half of the bat, as it was bowled full and wide of off. Simple catch for the man on the boundary, who took it with a reverse cup. <strong>Ireland go 1-0 up in the series</strong>
That is it from us tonight, as Ireland take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Not many gave them a chance, with the likes of Rashid and Nabi in the opposition's bowling attack, but Tector's fifty led the way for them. It is goodnight and goodbye from Ranjith and me, Himanshu, as we see you again for the second T20I in two days' time. Take care! <strong>Paul Stirling</strong>, Ireland captain: "Really happy. It was a fantastic team performance. Their bowling attack is pretty special... We have a big two months ahead. So we've got to put this behind. We have to perform at our best to win games. As a team, we performed brilliantly - and that is where we want to be." <strong>Rashid Khan</strong>, Afghanistan captain, says the early wickets lost is where it went wrong for his side. <strong>Ben White is the Player of the Match</strong> for his 4 for 20: "Really nice to contribute. It's really nice to be back [after the back injury]. Had to respect the umpire's decision [regarding the no-ball]. Nice to take a few [wickets]." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> <strong>11.35pm</strong> A come-from-behind win by Ireland. With the bat, they were 72 for 5 in the 12th over, but went on to post 149 in 20 overs. When defending, Afghanistan were 43 for 3 in the seventh over, and the game was in the balance. But Ben White took four wickets after that - he finished with 4 for 20 - as Afghanistan folded for 111, and Ireland won by 38 runs. Hang around for the presentations.
