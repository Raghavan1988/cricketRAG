Nice to take a few [wickets]." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> <strong>11.35pm</strong> A come-from-behind win by Ireland. With the bat, they were 72 for 5 in the 12th over, but went on to post 149 in 20 overs. When defending, Afghanistan were 43 for 3 in the seventh over, and the game was in the balance. But Ben White took four wickets after that - he finished with 4 for 20 - as Afghanistan folded for 111, and Ireland won by 38 runs. Hang around for the presentations.
