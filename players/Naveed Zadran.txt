Naveed

ahh, this is nearly a yorker on off, as Naveed pushes at it in a unique way by almost playing with bat behind front pad, and from deep in the crease
Ajay: "Is the pitch really difficult to bat on or are Afghanistan throwing it away here?" --- I'd say Ireland have been really good, aided by the ball which is still swinging and even moving off the pitch

<strong>High full toss and it's carved over deep third. Not a no-ball, think Adair's gotten away here.</strong> Side-on replay shows that it was just over the trouser. The players, despite the replay, will walk out. No change in decision. Naveed reacted brilliantly there, he was taken aback but slashed it in time.
<strong>Andrew McBrine</strong>: "I tried to keep it simple. Bee wit of help. Tried to hit back of length, three-quarter way up the stumps and mix the pace up when possible. The two batters in the middle did well but we fought back right after and then in the end. Tricky part is the first ten overs with the swing but there can be dew. Hope the top order sets the platform." <strong>7.22pm</strong> Ireland won the toss and bowled first, they've restricted Afghanistan well but the tail has taken the hosts to 236. It's a slow pitch and Gurbaz's strong start may have threatened the visitors early on, after the 150-run stand last game. But they got their act together in the middle overs. Barry McCarthy went into the pitch to get a miscued pull from Ibrahim Zadran. Adair got his bunny, Rahmat, and celebrated as such. McBrine got the big fish with a soft dismissal. Omarzai's run out soon after rang alarm bells for the hosts but a proactive Mohammad Nabi joined a sedate Hashmatullah Shahidi and they milked the bowling with risk-free shots to keep ticking. Van Woerkom and McBrine bowled decently and didn't allow the scoring to flow freely. Shahidi made his slowest fifty but starved Nabi the strike for a little while. The sun set and Afghanistan's players got into their <i>Iftar</i> at the start of the final powerplay. Nabi's attempt to go big have van Woerkom a breakthrough. Harry Tector, with his golden arm, prised out the skipper. Afghanistan's tail was faltering but the last two added 15 to take them to a respectable score. Himanshu will be on after the break, to call the chase.

The last pair will face the last over. They've been trying to sneak ones and twos, might continue doing it unless they see it in the slot early
