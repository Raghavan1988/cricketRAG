Touch too full and straight, misses the yorker and Imad calmly <strong>smacks </strong>it through the line bisecting long on and long off for a four, that boundary also brings up 150 on the board, it's not over yet!

Four away from deep third and deep backward point, just gets enough on the bat to get a boundary, gave too much width on this occasion, he put everything behind it and got lucky as well. This is going right down to the wire! Imad did it for Islamabad on a couple of occasions in PSL 9, can he get Pakistan over the line ?

Wow, Neesham gets the job done. Bowls it full on a tighter line outside off, he scythes it away to deep cover-point and Pakistan fall short of four runs, New Zealand win second match in a row. What a thriller we had which has brought tears in the eyes of some young fans in the aisles, emotions getting better of some spectators. New Zealand live up to their motto and ethos; once again they fought till the very end and edged out Pakistan in their fortress. It was a high intensity tug of war that went right till the last ball
A close game that kept us on the edge of our seats. New Zealand continue to impress with a young team and are now in a position to win the series. On the other hand, Pakistan are trying different combinations and testing their bench but they got to remember that winning is a habit and they'll need wins to start their World Cup campaign with high spirits. Neesham bowled well in the last over, bringing his experience to the fore and the young pacers rose to the occasion as well which shows New Zealand cricket is headed in the right direction. It's time to bring down the curtain on this game. We'll look forward to your company on Saturday for the final T20I of the series. For now, it's goodbye and goodnight from Rvel Zahid <strong>William O'Rourke, Player of the Match:</strong> We are learning together at the moment, trying to get better at every match and it's working well. I think the crowd were very loud out there, it was a very cool experience <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> I think we restricted them in bowling really well. We were expecting 190-200 but bowlers stuck to their plans, it was chase able, but we had a batting collapse. We lost three-four wickets in powerplay but Fakhar's innings was outstanding. We wanted to chase it with positive intent but we were unable to do so. When you lose back to back wickets, you need a few overs to catch up but that we got derailed in that period. It was a different surface; we were coming back after a long time, average score is 190 so I think we restricted them well. There were some changes due to injuries but youngsters put in a great effort. Our plan was to give proper opportunity to (test our) bench strength and see where we stand and we wanted to play different combinations. Hopefully we will have the team ready come the time of World Cup. <strong>Michael Bracewell, New Zealand Captain:</strong> The way we have learned from game to game is hugely important. Fortunately, we are able to come on the right side today. Pakistan bowlers bowled particularly well at the death. The openers got us ahead of the game. We weren't' able to get to 200 but I think credit to Pakistan bowlers. It's a huge positive for us that we are able to expose new guys, we backed Neesham to bowl those hard overs and he was able to close out today. I think our last five overs as a bowling unit were particularly impressive. Pete: "Great win. With lots of players injured, with the IPL, and playing county cricket this shows the great depth in NZ cricket. It is time to move on from the likes of Southee, Boult, and Williamson. They've been great servants but shouldn't be picked for the WorldT20." Badar: "Passion, confidence, and the hunger to outperform your much stronger opposition is what sets apart the Kiwis from their timid headless hosts." Hassan Nasir: "How many dot balls in this Pakistani innings? I would like to assert the importance of 1s and 2s here, and point out that NZ did take their opportunities in this regard in the middle game? " GormintAunty: "No one seems to be mentioning the 11 wides..." Jamal: "iftikhar's innings cost us the match, unbelievable display of fast bowling from NZ " Salman: "Months of mismanagement and zero continuity has got us here. " Mazahir: "I think Pakistan has to get back to Babar and Rizwan as an opening pair,"
