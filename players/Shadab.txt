In the air and <strong>Neesham</strong> doesn't errs on this occasion, didn't have to move much at deep midwicket and swallows it down his throat at deep midwicket, tossed up, wicket to wicket with some drift in, early through the hoick and Shadab has thrown his wicket away at a crucial juncture of the game. Mistimed it, just when Pakistan were getting a semblance of control, another wicket falls down. New Zealand sit in a strong position, one more wicket and it will become a herculean task for Pakistan to keep the asking rate in check, Imad and Iftikhar coming in next
Salman: "Required run rate already 10. Not gonna be easy in Lahore  as this is a bigger ground than Pindi" Zohaib: "Finding proper opening pair struggles still continue for Pakistan. They will again have to fall back to conventional duo of Babar/Rizwan which doesn't suit modern T20 approach at all. Usman and Saim have both disappointed. Players don't get proper exposure in PSL due to lack of quality international players and ultimately struggle in international cricket. "

Pakistan scrapped their way to 178/5, around 10-20 runs short of what Babar Azam was eyeing for at the toss. Babar Azam's intent was refreshing as he went for his strokes with freedom, but Saim Ayub got out early in the powerplay once again. New Zealand did well at the middle and kept a lid on the score. It's still a decent total on this wicket, but a couple of batters, including Fakhar and Iftikhar, didn't find their tempo on this slowish surface. Pakistan will fight tooth and nail to level the series, but New Zealand will not make it easy at all. I'll be back with you in a few minutes Zain: "We have tried so many options at number 4-5 but it is astonishing that we never tried Shadab there. " Ali Hashmi: "Abrar was rested despite good performance. Today he should have been included rather than Usama Mir. " Imran: "How was Fakhar not given out on that hit wicket incident? The argument is "The umpire called it wide and the ball was dead?" A wide ball is not a dead ball. Even when a batsman gets stumped on a wide, the wide is called before the keeper dislodges the bails."
