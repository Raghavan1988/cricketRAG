Elsewhere in wrestling, the global body has lifted its suspension on the Wrestling Federation of India. But what does this mean for Indian wrestling? Who runs the WFI now?

plays back onto the stumps, solid block, to end another gripping session
<B>2.12pm</B> Well, gripping is the operative word. The pitch was just starting to offer something for England's spinners in the hour after drinks, and Shoaib Bashir in particular took full advantage. Men round the bat throughout and three of England's four wickets have gone his way. Yashasvi Jaiswal, as ever, is a class apart for India, but even he had a dicey moment with the low edge that went his way on umpire's review. The deficit remains a hefty 222, but as England showed after losing early wickets, there is a way back with the bat. Particularly if the young guns who seized the Rajkot Test get going this evening. Sid will be back to talk you through it shortly. Pranay: "Not sure if it was clever decision to send in Jadeja ahead of Sarfaraz, left right combination with Jaiswal would have worked for India" SKD: "The younger brother has pulled Mumbai out of trouble with a magnificent double century. What can elder brother do here?

slows it down, 86ks, nice dip on this, Sarfaraz ends up defending well in front of his body. There is an appeal for lbw. Not given, and they review it. Again no turn, but the fact that he is not close enough to it means the lack of turn has time to beat his inside edge. He is hit on the back thigh, but he is quite bent, and is not an especially tall man. Anyway it is not the height that saves him, but the lack of turn. The angle is taking it down the leg side. <strong>England lose a review</strong>
