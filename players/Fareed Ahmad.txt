cleans him up with a yorker! Asitha went with one angling across the left-hander, and got it to dip on a yorker length on off. Fareed, with his right leg cleared, looked to go hard at it, but the ball landed at the base of his bat. It took a little bottom edge, and hit middle and leg stump. A very good delivery from Asitha

From around to the left-hander Fareed

quite full, and just outside off. Fareed slices it hard after getting his front leg out of the way, with the pace on the ball taking it away to deep backward point

good ball. Bowls a yorker angling it across, and lands it on fourth stump, as Fareed looks to squeeze it out but is beaten
