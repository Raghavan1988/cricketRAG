<strong>no need for DRS this time! This is beautiful, beautiful bowling!</strong> Superbly-disguised googly on a full length just outside off. Drops on Tanzim devilishly and he has no clue this is the wrong'un. Plays for the turn and plays down the wrong line eventually. Ball sneaks past his inside edge and thuds into the stumps. Bangladesh <em>are</em> seven down now, and those associated with Nepal (fans and players) are having a splash (literally in some cases too)!

<strong>another big appeal, and the finger goes up! Bangladesh seven down!</strong> Fizzed in quicker and on a full length on off. Tanzim has a huge swipe across the line and misses it completely. Gets thumped on the back leg, and that looks very out. <strong>But Tanzim has reviewed this because, well, why not. Does so just as the clock ticks down too. The only thing that could save him is impact or if the ball bounces exponentially, like it did in Miller's case a couple of days ago. Nothing on UltraEdge. Ball Tracking comes up and hang on....it shows the ball would have spun past off stump. Scratch everything that was written before because Tanzim is still around!</strong>
