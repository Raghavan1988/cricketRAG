Rahmat Shah c Miller b Ngidi 26 (46b 2x4 0x6 58m) SR: 56.52
<strong>takes him five attempts probably, but Miller gets it done!</strong> Length outside off. Rahmat tries to drive on the up but cannot keep his shot down. The ball flies off the outer half of the bat towards Miller at backward point. Seems a fairly regulation chance but Miller fumbles at the first attempt. The ball then pops out and he performs a sweet, little juggling act before eventually holding onto the chance, inches off the turf. Afghanistan lose their fourth!

<strong>Axar has Rahmat chopping on</strong>! Darted flat and quick just outside off, Rahmat backs away and aims to thrash it through the off side but does not have enough room to free his arms. He ends up dragging a thick inside edge back onto his own stumps. The drink will taste sweeter for Axar and India

<strong>ahh, bowled next ball!</strong> Almost as if Adair wanted to avenge what happened last ball. The ball hits the side of the off stump, as it goes in the gap between bat and pad. Adair angled this one in, bowling on a length on middle and off. The ball, though, straightened away towards off, as Rahmat seemed clueless while half-defending at it from off stump. Adair gets two in the over, as Afghanistan seek a restart

loud appeal for lbw by Adair and co, but not given. This seemed to be heading down the leg side, though. But, but... <strong>Balbirnie reviews</strong> after some thought. The first replay hints that this would go down while doing too much, as it landed on a length outside off, and hit Rahmat's front knee as he was completely beaten by the movement. The impact was on middle, and replays indeed confirm the ball would have gone to miss the leg stump, so Ireland lose a review

Sabir Shah: "Afghan tigers are going well, AFG was very week in the last test match against bangladesh.But our blue tigers have a smash backup." <B>12.03pm</b> 90 runs and two wickets in that session. It's the visitors though that will be the happier of the two sides heading into the break. Yes they lost two wickets, including one off just the second ball of the Test, but on an unusually green SSC surface they've scored at a fair clip and not looked unduly troubled by Sri Lanka's trio of seamers. This pair have now put on 33. They've negotiated the spin of Prabath Jayasuriya quite well, with Rahmat Shah (45*) in particular keen on using his feet. The Lankan seamers meanwhile might be guilty of lacking patience and looking to make the ball do too much. Lots to discuss at the break then, particularly for the home side.

ShahSafeer: "I know Rashid Khan is out of team due to an injury but there are so many other options that have chosen not go participate in this Test. It shows how smaller teams' financial issues lead these players to choose league cricket over Test or international cricket! They could've become a massive Test side, particularly in Asian conditions" Thanks Abhimanyu. So Sri Lanka have pulled things back in the first hour after lunch, and now it's up to Afghanistan to rebuild. Four down midway through day 1 isn't ideal though.

Asitha Fernando to continue. Wide first slip and a close gully. ShahSafeer: "I know Rashid Khan is out of team due to an injury but there are so many other options that have chosen not go participate in this Test. It shows how smaller teams' financial issues lead these players to choose league cricket over Test or international cricket! They could've become a massive Test side, particularly in Asian conditions" Thanks Abhimanyu. So Sri Lanka have pulled things back in the first hour after lunch, and now it's up to Afghanistan to rebuild. Four down midway through day 1 isn't ideal though.

this turns in a bit from a length outside off, and Rahmat punches it late to bag four. He let the ball come before playing from deep in the crease. And though Nissanka chased and dived to his left, he couldn't stop it

Wouldnt be a problem if they slow down a bit but if they have a few wickets in hand in the death, they have firepower to accelerate in the end to take them to a healthy total. Hope they doesnt waste this golden opportunity to avoid the clean sweep !!  " This is a slower pitch than the previous matches though, Mustafa. Suspect something in the range of 300 would be enough if they bowl decently well.
