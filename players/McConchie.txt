<strong>Extraordinary stuff from Imad Wasim! </strong>Gets wicket on the first delivery of his spell! Around the wicket, length delivery spins back markedly into middle and he didn't pick him, no bat involved. Review has been taken, clear daylight between bat and pad, raps the back pad, pitching outside off, umpire's call on impact and hitting wickets so that's that. He wanted to tee off and accelerate without wasting any time but he has to take the long walk back to the pavilion, New Zealand lose their third in just six balls
