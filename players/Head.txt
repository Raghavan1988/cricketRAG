Warner and Head in the middle. Leask to open the bowling Welcome back, folks. A <i>huge</i> 20 overs ahead for Scotland (and England) Here's Jonny Bairstow speaking after the England game finished: "Look we can't, I'm sure we'll be keeping an eye on it for sure but at the same time there's not much we can do about what happens over there so yeah, we'll be keeping an eye on it of course we will but at the same time we've done everything that's in our hands. Now to go through, there was a lot of chat about the net run rate. There was a lot of chat about all of that stuff. We've overcome that net run rate and we've overcome the challenges that have been put in front of us. And as a group, we've stuck together really tightly. That Australia game was a tough game and they outplayed us in that, fair play to them. But the way that we've responded as a group, how tight we've stayed over the last week or so, we've accepted the challenge that's been put in front of us and we've responded very well to that."
