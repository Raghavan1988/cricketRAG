Looks like Moeen Ali to take the new ball; slip is in place Timeout with <b>Nick Knight</b> and <b>Wasim Jaffer</b> (and the marvelous Raunak) <b>12.55pm:</b> Here come the players and mascots, time for the anthems before things get pwopah nawty. England, it's worth noting, have won six of the last seven T20Is between these two - as well as the 2010 World T20 final on this very ground - but Australia are never less than dangerous in World Cups, and twisted the knife as England plunged out during the group stage of the ODI edition last year Here's Jack, who couldn't resist the (alarm) call: "Okay, it's nearly 3am in eastern Australia. I'm taking a big risk losing my sleep by getting up watch this. I hope that this game will be worth it!" <b>12.45pm:</b> They are using a new surface at Kensington Oval, though the suggestion from Matthew Hayden and Nasser Hussain at the pitch report is that it's going to be "a bit of a battle", with the wind playing a significant role, given one of the boundaries is only 58 metres. Both sides wanted to chase, of course, although there has been a slight bias towards defending on this ground in recent times Meanwhile,<a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/netherlands-vs-south-africa-16th-match-group-d-1415716/live-cricket-score> it's all going Pete Biltong for the Saffers in New York</a>... <b>12.32pm: England win the toss and bowl</b>, "short boundary with the wind," says Buttler, "little bit unsure how it's going to play." England have stuck with the same XI, while Cummins for Ellis is the only change for Australia. Marsh says he too would have bowled, but he's not too bothered (as you can imagine). He describes adding the T20 trophy to the ODI and Test titles Australia won last year as a "big carrot" for his side, but they're not looking beyond this game <b>Australia:</b> 1 David Warner, 2 Travis Head, 3 Mitchell Marsh (capt), 4 Glenn Maxwell, 5 Marcus Stoinis, 6 Matt Wade (wk), 7 Tim David, 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood <b>England:</b> 1 Phil Salt, 2 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 3 Will Jacks, 4 Jonny Bairstow, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Liam Livingstone, 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood <b>12.25pm:</b> Toss time is approaching, with one or two selection issues outstanding. England sound like they will be unchanged, which fits with their general modus operandi - allowing the same group to go again after an indifferent - albeit weather-affected - display. Australia are expected to bring Pat Cummins in for this one, probably at the expense of Nathan Ellis, despite his impressive showing against Oman. Mitchell Starc went off with cramp in that match but understood to be fit Jay: "I reckon bringing Topley in for Jordan would be good choice considering two left handers are opening for the Aussies." <b>12.10pm:</b> The temperature is rising in Bridgetown, and Mel is in situ: "Good morning from the Kensington Oval, which is far livelier than it's been all week. Let's hope it's a bumper crowd and a cracking game. It's very hot and humid and some clouds about but, so far, they're white and fluffy." <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/australia-vs-england-17th-match-group-b-1415717/live-match-blog>Matt has also got the live blog up and running</a>, if that's your preferred cup of char "This format is cruel and entertaining at the same time. England's washout against Scotland put them in a dangerous territory of getting knocked out early. Though, being current champs and having strong h2h record against the Aussies should help them to clinch the match!" We like a bit of jeopardy, ShahSafeer, although Jonny Bairstow was having none of it yesterday. Defeat would certainly make the second half of this group stage interesting for England "I think there's no doubt Cummins will play today, right ?" Yes, Neil, he's pretty nailed on to start this one.
