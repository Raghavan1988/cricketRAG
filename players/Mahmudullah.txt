<strong>Mahmudullah goes across and misses the flick, it hit the front pad and the lbw is given! He reviews</strong>. The line is the only thing that can save him. Looked close in real time but from the slow-mo replay, it looks like it's going down leg. <strong>Yeah, the angle on the full ball was too sharp. Down leg it is, decision overturned, but the ball did go to the boundary off the deflection. Because it was given out, the runs won't count</strong>

<strong>Mahmudullah connected but can't clear the long-on boundary. The crowd are stunned back to silence again.</strong> The veteran batter is in disbelief, has hand on head and has to walk back. It was in his favour - full toss looped outside off, he clubbed it with a flattish bat and got a lot of height. Markram ran to the left, timed his hop and took a brilliant catch
