Just one run needed to tie the scores. And two needed for a Bangladesh win

<b>Overthrows!</b> Bangladesh have done it! They have somehow dragged themselves over the line! Mahmudullah drives a full ball to mid-off and takes off for the single. The throw came in at the non-striker's end but was wayward and allows Bangladesh to run a second
<b>11.30pm</b> So that's that from this spicy rivalry, with Bangladesh taking home the points after a narrow, narrow win. There's more action to come, with South Africa going up against Netherlands and then England taking on Australia (later tonight, or first thing tomorrow, depending on where you're reading this from). For now, on behalf of Madushka and Thilak, this is Abhimanyu signing off. <b>11.20pm</b> Time for the presentation ceremony. Bangladesh skipper <b>Najmul Hossain Shanto</b>: "Everybody' body language was great, we gave our 120%. Last 10-15 days we have been making plans and all the fielders are doing their job. I think they bowled really well, but on a wicket like this we should have won this easily. Very important for Litton, he's been struggling a bit but he showed his skill today. I think he batted really well. Hridoy was really courageous, the way he played that over really helped us." Sri Lanka captain <b>Wanindu Hasaranga</b>: "Our batters batted really well in the first 8-10 overs. After that in the middle overs I think we batted badly. We all know our bowling attack is our strength. Specially if batters put up 150-160, our bowling attack can win games. Last two games the batters didn't do the job. It's tough. First two games we've lost. We bowled with four main bowlers. I think our four genuine bowlers did their job but unfortunately we had to make four overs with our allrounders." The player of the match is <b>Rishad Hossain</b>. Here's what he has to say: "The pitch was good, I tried my best. [On the hat-trick ball] Yeah I tried to bowl it as normal, did my best." Dr Nirav Hingra: "Only SA is topping their group at the moment from the full time member.. superb worldcup.." <b>11.05pm</b> As Bangladesh and Sri Lanka always promise, they have delivered a thriller. On a slightly slow pitch, legspinner Rishad Hossain starred as Sri Lanka were restricted to 124, despite Nissanka's excellent start. Then Sri Lanka got off to a dominant start with the ball thanks to DDS and Thushara, but Litton Das and Towhid Hridoy's partnership was enough to put Bangladesh in a winning position, especially Hridoy's three sixes off Hasaranga. Bangladesh lost a host of wickets after that, but those three sixes ensured the required run rate was manageable and Mahmudullah hung around till the end to give Bangladesh a much needed winning start to their 2024 T20 World Cup campaign. It was much closer than it should have been, and Bangladesh know their batting is still a worry, but the two points is what matters most right now for them.

<strong>Mahmudullah goes across and misses the flick, it hit the front pad and the lbw is given! He reviews</strong>. The line is the only thing that can save him. Looked close in real time but from the slow-mo replay, it looks like it's going down leg. <strong>Yeah, the angle on the full ball was too sharp. Down leg it is, decision overturned, but the ball did go to the boundary off the deflection. Because it was given out, the runs won't count</strong>

This is almost the last ball, but just a touch wider, which means it pitches juuuust in line with off probably, but could the swing be taking the ball past the off stump. Nope, it's not missing off, says the ball projection. It's clipping off stump, and there are two umpires' calls (on impact with pads, and impact with stumps), but Thushara has a hat trick.

Licon SEO: "@Rashad Mahbub, Don't you think that DLS method is unnecessary in cricket. Bangladesh needed 77 runs from 60 Balls. But according to the DLS method, Bangladesh may lose the match by 3 runs." To be honest, I believe it needs to be updated and changed to reflect modern cricket. Numerous new regulations have been implemented, so who knows? Perhaps we will soon witness an upgraded DLS approach, or maybe not.

Licon SEO: "@Rashad Mahbub, Don't you think that DLS method is unnecessary in cricket. Bangladesh needed 77 runs from 60 Balls. But according to the DLS method, Bangladesh may lose the match by 3 runs." To be honest, I believe it needs to be updated and changed to reflect modern cricket. Numerous new regulations have been implemented, so who knows? Perhaps we will soon witness an upgraded DLS approach, or maybe not.

Low full-toss on the off stump, drags it down the ground to deep mid wicket

<strong>You can't set a field for those!</strong> Fuller ball outside off, moves towards the line of the ball and smacks it through the covers to finish the game with a boundary!
And that's all for now. We are grateful for your attendance, and it was a pleasure to have you all here. Please tune in to the third T20I on May 7 at 3 PM local time in ZACS, Chattogram. In these circumstances, take care and maintain hydration. On behalf of Sudeep and the entire crew, this is Rashad signing off till then. <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto:</strong> "(Rain intervals) First of all the bowlers did very well. But as I said we can't control the rain, but it's not easy for the batsman. We have to manage all those things. There are lot of areas we can improve. (Zimbabwe) Can also play good cricket here. I think they have batted really well in the middle. Bowlers can do little bit but I am not worried about the bowling today. It helped our team the way Tamim and Litton started the innings with 40+ partnership. Later on Hridoy and Riyad bhai finished it up. (Next match) Day match so we have to plan for it." <strong>Player of the Match Towhid Hridoy:</strong> "(Hitting power) I just try to know the situation demand and try to execute that plan, nothing else. When I finish it obviously feels good for the team and for myself." <strong>Sikandar Raza:</strong> "(Start of the innings) To be 40 up with one boundary in the powerplay, and suddenly we were playing catch up cricket. But the way they've played in the middle order and the lower middle order to be able to score 140 odds. It is still the same story as we keep on shooting ourselves on the foot, a lot of lesson needed to be learned, one can only hope we can learn eventually. (Youngsters performance) We have got the youngsters in for a reason as well, we have got one eye in the future as well, the board and the team has a vision too. We just have to groom these youngsters one at at time. Very well done to the way they played and certainly put us in a respectable position. But the runs scored doesn't matter to me. The brand of cricket has been really poor especially in the first ten overs of the innings and that hurts me a lot. Hopefully the individuals will improve and we are gonna play the better brand of cricket. (Bowler's effort) Shamim bhai, to tell you the truth, I don't think we could have bowled any better. Three rain breaks did not help with the wet ball. I almost stopped bowling in my last over because of the wet outfield and ball. I tried to shine and dry it. Shamim bhai, we could not bowl any better on this condition so credit to the bowlers. Yes, we could have helped the bowlers as well because when the conditions are tough each and everyone needs to step up but unfortunately we could not do that. We fix one thing and suddenly we have two more things to fix. It's been the story as well. So hopefully we can fix everything soon." <strong>Presentation ceremony:</strong> Bangladesh fared very well in the opening half of the innings, but later on, because of Hridoy and Riyad's aggressive batting, they were able to comfortably reach the target. Three rain delays occurred, which further hampered the efforts of both teams. Up until the most recent rain delay, Zimbabwe was fully engaged in the match, despite struggling mightily with grasping the ball and making a few mistakes on the pitch. <strong>Bangladesh won the match by six wickets.</strong>
