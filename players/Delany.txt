<strong>Mighty hit to end the innings!</strong> Gwandu once again bowls a length ball in line of the stumps. Delany stands deep in his crease and pulls it straight over the bowler's head. Walks away as soon as he makes contact off the meat of the bat
<b>8:02pm</b> A 20-run final over makes the picture look better for Ireland, who had turned up in three parts. The first of those was when Balbirnie and Stirling walked out to open. They came out blazing and used the feet as well as moved around the crease and punished the erractic new-ball fast bowlers. But then Raza brought out Zimbabwe's trump card - spin. He, Williams and Burl put the skids on the scoring and Ireland looked to be in danger of folding out cheaply. Till Delany walked out to bat. He picked Muzarabani's change of pace before tearing into debutant Gwandu. Will 147 be enough for Ireland? Or will Zimbabwe hunt it down under lights? Remember, this is the first international game in Harare under floodlights and we don't really know what the conditions will play out like. Join Abhimanyu soon to find just that.

That's it from us, as Afghanistan levelled the three-match series against Ireland. Nabi and Rashid led the way, with the decider taking place tomorrow evening. Until then, it is goodnight and goodbye from Vairavan, Harshith, and me, Himanshu! Azweer: "Hope the fans saved some nails for the series decider" --- And I saved my fingers and some energy for it... <strong>Rashid Khan, Afghanistan's captain, is the Player of the Match</strong>. He said there were brief nervous moments, but there are players who can take it away, referring to Nabi's fifty from 14 for 4. <strong>Paul Stirling</strong>, Ireland captain: "Great game. They all seem to be close. I am actually happy how we performed. We have another chance tomorrow. They bowled well up top. But the partnership brought them back in the game." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> <strong>Mohammad Nabi</strong>: "There was a bit of pressure for the first few overs. But when I realised that the wicket is good for batting, I told my partner Sadiq that let us play it ball by ball. The ball was gripping, and if you bowled a variation, it was difficult. It was a match-changing wicket [of Stirling]. We'll try our best to play good cricket, and hopefully win [the series]." <strong>11.31pm</strong> Afghanistan make it 1-1 despite Ireland starting the chase in command, and despite being 14 for 4 with the bat. And once again, it was their spinners who applied the brakes. Rashid took four after grabbing three in the first T20I, after Nabi bashed 59 in a counterattack with the bat. The Player-of-the-Match remains for one of these two. So hang around for the presentations.

Imperious, in the slot for Delany and he doesn't miss out, goes deep in his crease and pounded hard away from the bowler towards long-off for a four and they finish the innings in style, 17 runs off the last over, it's a big one. 193/7, certainly defendable
Ireland batters thrived at Castle Avenue and racked up an imposing total. They'll be pretty happy with the total. Tucker slammed a quickfire fifty and the entire middle order made an impact. Delany's 10-ball 28 gave them the impetus as Pakistan pacers, in particular, missed their targets quite a lot. Mohammad Amir's cutters weren't that effective, and once again, too many balls went down the leg side. The last over went for 17. Does Ireland have enough on the board? Possibly a winning score. Back in a few minutes.

Shot: ON_DRIVE
Run scored: 4


Imperious, in the slot for Delany and he doesn't miss out, goes deep in his crease and pounded hard away from the bowler towards long-off for a four and they finish the innings in style, 17 runs off the last over, it's a big one. 193/7, certainly defendable
Ireland batters thrived at Castle Avenue and racked up an imposing total. They'll be pretty happy with the total. Tucker slammed a quickfire fifty and the entire middle order made an impact. Delany's 10-ball 28 gave them the impetus as Pakistan pacers, in particular, missed their targets quite a lot. Mohammad Amir's cutters weren't that effective, and once again, too many balls went down the leg side. The last over went for 17. Does Ireland have enough on the board? Possibly a winning score. Back in a few minutes.

Strays in his line, that's a duff short ball outside leg stump, he gets in a perfection position to lift it up and over fine leg for six, v<strong>ery loose delivery and duly dispatched!</strong>
Faraz: "PCB shouldn't have appointed Babar as Captain again. And if they did, Babar should not have accepted it. He is not a good captain and not a leader at all. He needs to admit it. Sachin was not a good captain. There's no shame in not being a good captain."

Gets it right into the blockhole, clonked it away into the leg side and the fielder slips, they'll wind up getting another run

Pace-off short cutter around the line off, gets right behind the line and lashes it downtown, fumbled at long-on means Ireland get another four and it's 181 on the board, already a pretty respectable total

Thumped hard into the surface, a slow rising ball wide of off, can't connect on this occasion as he looked to slash it away
