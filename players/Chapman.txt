That's all we have for you from this T20I series. Many thanks for your company and comments. Until next time, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf on P Ranjith. Take care and cheers. <b>Matthew Wade, Australia captain</b>: Strange game with rain on and off. Trying to make use of the shorter boundaries here. No matter where it is, it is such a strong squad and unreal to be with the boys here. Grateful to play with the guys. Nice as a batter [at Eden Park] but nervous when we bowled. But one of the most clinical performances and Short is exciting for the future. Everyone knows the World Cup is coming in and we had a look at the guys - Short, Ellis - and picking that 15 for the World Cup.
