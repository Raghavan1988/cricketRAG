<b>8.45pm</b> After opting to bat, NZ had an explosive opening stand from Allen and Conway, but wonder if they're about 10-15 runs short on this belter of a pitch against a near full-strength Australia side. Here's <b>Rachin Ravindra</b>, one of the stars of NZ's innings: "Surreal. I've spent a lot of time here and it's the first time for me playing for NZ in Wellington. It took me a bit of time, but nice to have Dev get the scoreboard going at the other end. The way Finn and Devon took the bowlers on, it was easier for me. That's the nature of being a No.3. It's a pretty good score; I'd say 200 is about par and hopefully we get the win. We will try to be unpredictable with the ball and try to mix it up a little bit."

Marsh collects the Chappell-Hadlee trophy and celebrates with his team-mates. That's all we have for you from this T20I series. Many thanks for your company and comments. Until next time, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf on P Ranjith. Take care and cheers. <b>Matthew Wade, Australia captain</b>: Strange game with rain on and off. Trying to make use of the shorter boundaries here. No matter where it is, it is such a strong squad and unreal to be with the boys here. Grateful to play with the guys. Nice as a batter [at Eden Park] but nervous when we bowled. But one of the most clinical performances and Short is exciting for the future. Everyone knows the World Cup is coming in and we had a look at the guys - Short, Ellis - and picking that 15 for the World Cup. A lot of credit goes to the support staff and this venue isn't a happy hunting ground for bowlers and it definitely swung around for what's longer in a T20. <b>Mitch Santner</b>: They're a quality side, their quicks and the power they possess. The first one was a close one and we kind of got outplayed in the last two. We showed some good stuff throughout the series but the powerplay is hard to bowl here. Dropped catches never help. I think the depth in the squad is good and if those guys come back in, hard for these guys to be in. But there might be slower pitches in the World Cup. Some good stuff and bad stuff; that's cricket. <b>Mitch Marsh, Player of the Series</b>: Nice to contribute to a winning team and that's what we ask for our guys. To win 3-0 is fantastic for our bowlers. It's not added pressure - it's added responsibility. The other leaders in the group make our job easy and it's a great bunch. Any series win for your country is fantastic. I'm proud and a big year leading into the World Cup. Spencer Johnson...and everyone grabbing their opportunity. Probably David Warner before he got injured and Maxi (who is the best golfer in the side?) Abinash: "Starc, Johnson, Ellis, Hazlewood, Cummins. That's stacked with some quality bowlers there" Tighthead: "Ferguson and Sears are the only players who can hold their heads high across the series. The NZ batsmen were not good enough with no consistency shown. The fielding was horrendous. Enough said......" Jay: "Other than Phillips and Allen this NZ XI lacks clean hitters. Also bowling first hasn't been a right call for the last two games." <strong>4.50pm</strong> So a DLS win by 27 runs helps Australia clean sweep New Zealand 3-0. It was always a mountain to climb for the hosts the moment they needed a revised 126 in just ten overs, and despite the threat of Allen, Phillips and co - and the shorter boundaries around - they fell well short. Good result for Australia in what is their final series before the T20 World Cup, though. NZ will rue the dropped chances. Hang around for the presentation formalities before Australia lift the T20 Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.

Over the wicket, shortens his length and keeps it tight on an off-stump line, hits the ball hard and the outside edge skews away to deep third and that'll be the winning runs. New Zealand have levelled the series with a surprising comeback despite having a depleted side!  The win has brought the series to life!
We hope you enjoyed our coverage. The fourth match will be held in Lahore on the 25th of April. This is Rvel Zahid signing off on behalf of the team at Cricinfo. Watch out for Danyal's report. Goodnight! Pakistan's bowlers had a poor day at the office and were put under pressure by Mark Chapman's onslaught. The swashbuckling southpaw received just enough support to guide his team to the doorstep of victory. The likes of Naseem Shah and Shaheen Shah weren't accurate enough and gave too much room in crunch situations. There was a bit of a stutter towards the middle of the innings, and Pakistan fell short of posting an imposing total. A few drops at crucial junctures swung the momentum in favor of New Zealand and they made sure not to botch up the chase. The night belongs to Mark Chapman, though, who played many eye-catching strokes and showed composure while facing one of his favorite opponents <strong>Mark Chapman, Player of the Match: </strong> It's always nice to come here, thankfully we have levelled the series today. I think we know Pakistan have a great attack, 178 was as chase-able score, generally it's high scoring here. Debutants bowled some tough overs and Ish was outstanding. Yesterday it was slower and we lost wickets in clumps...you have 100 partnership, you give yourself a good chance to win. The way Siefert and Robinson set it up, we had a platform and we just tried to keep up with the rate, we knew they have a world class attack... <strong>Michael Bracewell, New Zealand Captain:</strong> Really happy with the way guys put the learnings from last night...particularly impressed the way two debutants went tonight, big occasion to play in front of a full crowd, it puts us in good stead going forward...I think the way Ish bowled in the middle was outstanding; he has done that for a number of years for New Zealand, the guys right at the backend brought it back. I think the partnership between <em>Foxy</em> and Chapman was outstanding...(appreciates Chapman and his consistency) <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> Maybe we were 10 runs short, not easy to get going for a new batter so Rizwan's unavailability proved costly at that stage. 180-190 is a par score. I think we did well in batting. It depends on situation (On Shadab's batting position), he executed the plan and played his natural game. Saim started really well and did what was required. We started well with the ball in first six overs, but when you drop a set batter's catch then he will take away the game from you, Chapman has always done well against us. New Zealand have sprung a surprise by pulling off a clinical win after that crushing defeat less than 24 hours ago! Chapman was audacious as usual and continues his stellar record in Pakistan. They just needed a couple of partnerships, which they got, and Pakistan panicked in the last 10 overs. Naseem Shah was uncharacteristically off the boil, and Shaheen Afridi leaked plenty Mudasir shagoo : "40 runs from 2 overs of shaheen and Naseem was the turning point of the match. A captain cant help his team when main bowlers didn't work out for him." Dr Mirza Zeshan: "Chapman champion.  "

A few drops at crucial junctures swung the momentum in favor of New Zealand and they made sure not to botch up the chase. The night belongs to Mark Chapman, though, who played many eye-catching strokes and showed composure while facing one of his favorite opponents <strong>Mark Chapman, Player of the Match: </strong> It's always nice to come here, thankfully we have levelled the series today. I think we know Pakistan have a great attack, 178 was as chase-able score, generally it's high scoring here. Debutants bowled some tough overs and Ish was outstanding. Yesterday it was slower and we lost wickets in clumps...you have 100 partnership, you give yourself a good chance to win. The way Siefert and Robinson set it up, we had a platform and we just tried to keep up with the rate, we knew they have a world class attack... <strong>Michael Bracewell, New Zealand Captain:</strong> Really happy with the way guys put the learnings from last night...particularly impressed the way two debutants went tonight, big occasion to play in front of a full crowd, it puts us in good stead going forward...I think the way Ish bowled in the middle was outstanding; he has done that for a number of years for New Zealand, the guys right at the backend brought it back. I think the partnership between <em>Foxy</em> and Chapman was outstanding...(appreciates Chapman and his consistency) <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> Maybe we were 10 runs short, not easy to get going for a new batter so Rizwan's unavailability proved costly at that stage. 180-190 is a par score. I think we did well in batting. It depends on situation (On Shadab's batting position), he executed the plan and played his natural game. Saim started really well and did what was required. We started well with the ball in first six overs, but when you drop a set batter's catch then he will take away the game from you, Chapman has always done well against us. New Zealand have sprung a surprise by pulling off a clinical win after that crushing defeat less than 24 hours ago! Chapman was audacious as usual and continues his stellar record in Pakistan. They just needed a couple of partnerships, which they got, and Pakistan panicked in the last 10 overs. Naseem Shah was uncharacteristically off the boil, and Shaheen Afridi leaked plenty Mudasir shagoo : "40 runs from 2 overs of shaheen and Naseem was the turning point of the match. A captain cant help his team when main bowlers didn't work out for him." Dr Mirza Zeshan: "Chapman champion.  "

Osman: "It is about time Pak team shuffles its batting order and brings in big hitters at the top and stop relying on the 150-180 approach. It no longer works on these flat pitches."

<strong>Zingers are alight!</strong> Went too far away across his stumps for an ambitious sweep shot and Usama Mir zips it quicker on off-stump, he fails to connect and the ball rips through the stumps. That is a massive wicket in the context of the game! Chapman looks disconsolate after perishing early in the piece. Turning out to be a fabulous spell, producing magic tonight!
