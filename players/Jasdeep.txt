Yashasvi Pant: "Why is Dipendra Singh Airee held back after those 2 awesome overs? He is nowadays our main bowler more than a batsman. Captain should use him to get it done." He was brought on to bowl only when a left-hander was in the middle and was taken out as soon as he got Gajanand Singh out. I agree with you Yashasvi and believe it's borderline insulting to say that a bowler of his quality should only be used to get left-handers out. He bowls equally well to right-handers.

Tossed up legbreak on a full length, width on offer, he picked the length early and pounded it over the bowler's head for a blistering boundary. That was absolutely leathered!

Jasdeep Singh run out (†Pant/Mohammed Siraj) 2 (7b 0x4 0x6 11m) SR: 28.57
good finish, pace back on, beats a wild wipe to leg, the batters sprint for the bye, but Pant lobs to Siraj, whose direct hit at the bowler's end is true. <B>Out by three metres</B>. 111 will be the target
<B>12.11pm</B> Well, that was a gutsy effort from USA, after losing two wickets in their opening over. Arshdeep was magnificent throughout, but India took their foot off the throat, with an odd over from Dube and no sign of Jadeja. Bumrah went wicketless for a change as Taylor and Nitish led the line with a brace of 20s. Hardik was excellent with the ball too. Here is Nitish for his mid-match thoughts: "We're a bit disappointed, 20 short, but in past games 110 has been pretty tough. Nice playing this big crowd, wicket wasn't the easiest, but all about getting a big total." Short and to the point. Ekanth will be here for the chase shortly. Andrea : "These low-scoring games remind me of the good old days when there was always something in it for the bowlers. Love the back and forth between bowler and batsman." Vikram : "USA has done better than I expected. Well done USA. Let's C what India can do. Hope they all bat like Rishabh Pant"

RiwajAdhikari: "If you ask me honestly, I feel South Africa have already used up their slot of allotted luck of this tournament in the first 4 league games. Now onwards, anything can happen." They've won by being the better side today though

full and straight, smacked to mid-off and they don't even bother running as South Africa seal an <strong>18-run victory</strong>. The USA gave them a scare, but South Africa were the dominant side for much of this game, <b>and are now five in five at this World Cup</b>
"Pretty happy with the performance as a whole, says Markram. "A couple of overs here and there we need to tidy up. I think you always feel you need more runs. But the wicket definitely changes and gets a bit slower, and they were a lot less sloppy.  A couple of lessons to take, but nice for the batters to be in the middle and get some runs, especially for Quinny to really get his flow." "Hard to take a defeat after coming so close," says Aaron Jones. "But we did lack discipline in the bowling at times. Once we play good cricket we can beat any team in the world. But we need to be a lot more disciplined." <strong>Quinton de Kock is player of the match</strong>. "We've had some tricky wickets so it was nice to spend sometime in the middle today. The USA put us under pressure towards the end. It was a great game. "We've still got a couple more games to win. Different venue, different surfaces. Never know what you're going to get out there." Snake Eyes: "As lucky as the Springboks at the last World Cup!!" Rather be lucky than good, I'd imagine taj: "Ice cold over from Rabada, that. Wow. Surely PoTM given the context?
