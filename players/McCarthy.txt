cleans him up! Kharote hits back immediately after being hit for a six. This stays low off a length on middle and leg, as it skidded through to beat McCarthy's attempted slash. Kharote has four on debut, as <b>Afghanistan win by 117 runs take the series 2-0</b>
So Afghanistan win the ODI series after coming second in the one-off Test, and Shahidi lifts the series trophy along with his team-mates. Incredible comeback from their spinners after Ireland were entirely on track in their chase of 237. But Nabi used his experience to good effect, while the debutant Kharote showed what he was capable of too. Join us for the T20I leg of the tour in a few days' time, as we wrap up the ODIs. Goodnight and goodbye from Ranjith, Sudeep, Ekanth, and me, Himanshu! <strong>Hashmatullah Shahidi</strong>, Afghanistan captain: "Very happy with the performance. Stirling and Campher were playing very well. But when I was batting, I knew the wicket wasn't easy for batting. So I brought on Nabi. It was a critical partnership [with Nabi]. Nabi and I wanted to take the game till the end. I told him to make it to the 45th over. We did it, and it was good. It was the first ODI pitch, and while we were batting, it was slower compared to the last game. When they were bowling, the ball wasn't coming. Nabi is an amazing player. He always contributes. For other players, he is inspirational." <strong>Paul Stirling</strong>, Ireland captain: "We seemed to be in a pretty good position to chase that down. We were pretty happy with today's performance [with the ball]. I can't really put my finger on it [the collapse]. That is something we will think about in the next couple of days. I think there was a lot of dew in the first game [and hence he bowled first]. It didn't come in today, and that probably cost us." <strong>Rahmanullah Gurbaz is the Player of the Series</strong>: "It was a great series for me, and my team as well. Not happy with the bat today because I had got set. But it's an exciting moment as we won the match. I always try to do something better. We were focused more [than the one-off Test], and got the result as well. I want to dedicate this award to Nangeyalia, and all the best for his future." <strong>Mohammad Nabi is the Player of the Match</strong>: "Really happy to perform in those conditions. Five wickets [came] after a long time - it has been 17 or 18 years [15 years]! I saw Stirling hit a six, so in the next over I told Ibrahim to put mid-off back, and bowled wicket-to-wicket. I didn't think about my fifty; I just tried to put a good score for the team." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> <strong>Jonathan Trott</strong>, Afghanistan's coach: "I thought we were a bit short to be honest... but then we saw the wicket slow down. With two new spinners, it's important in a series like this that we perform well. [Against] Sri Lanka, we didn't play the cricket we know we can. It was important we came back in this series and did well. It's important we don't get too far ahead of ourselves; cricket is a great leveler." <strong>10.10pm</strong> Ireland lose 8 for 26 in a staggering collapse, as what was 93 for 2 in the 22nd over turned out to be 119 all out after 35. The ball was turning for Nabi and debutant Kharote, with a few skidding through sharply too. It wasn't easy for a new batter to start on this slow pitch, and Ireland's batters departed one after the other. As a result, Nabi got his maiden ODI five-for 15 years after his debut, and Kharote finished with four in his first game. Hang around for the presentations.

McCarthy is OUT! bowled
 b Nangeyalia Kharote
Barry McCarthy b Nangeyalia Kharote 8 (18b 0x4 1x6 23m) SR: 44.44
cleans him up! Kharote hits back immediately after being hit for a six. This stays low off a length on middle and leg, as it skidded through to beat McCarthy's attempted slash. Kharote has four on debut, as <b>Afghanistan win by 117 runs take the series 2-0</b>
So Afghanistan win the ODI series after coming second in the one-off Test, and Shahidi lifts the series trophy along with his team-mates. Incredible comeback from their spinners after Ireland were entirely on track in their chase of 237. But Nabi used his experience to good effect, while the debutant Kharote showed what he was capable of too. Join us for the T20I leg of the tour in a few days' time, as we wrap up the ODIs. Goodnight and goodbye from Ranjith, Sudeep, Ekanth, and me, Himanshu! <strong>Hashmatullah Shahidi</strong>, Afghanistan captain: "Very happy with the performance. Stirling and Campher were playing very well. But when I was batting, I knew the wicket wasn't easy for batting. So I brought on Nabi. It was a critical partnership [with Nabi]. Nabi and I wanted to take the game till the end. I told him to make it to the 45th over. We did it, and it was good. It was the first ODI pitch, and while we were batting, it was slower compared to the last game. When they were bowling, the ball wasn't coming. Nabi is an amazing player. He always contributes. For other players, he is inspirational." <strong>Paul Stirling</strong>, Ireland captain: "We seemed to be in a pretty good position to chase that down. We were pretty happy with today's performance [with the ball]. I can't really put my finger on it [the collapse]. That is something we will think about in the next couple of days. I think there was a lot of dew in the first game [and hence he bowled first]. It didn't come in today, and that probably cost us." <strong>Rahmanullah Gurbaz is the Player of the Series</strong>: "It was a great series for me, and my team as well. Not happy with the bat today because I had got set. But it's an exciting moment as we won the match. I always try to do something better. We were focused more [than the one-off Test], and got the result as well. I want to dedicate this award to Nangeyalia, and all the best for his future." <strong>Mohammad Nabi is the Player of the Match</strong>: "Really happy to perform in those conditions. Five wickets [came] after a long time - it has been 17 or 18 years [15 years]! I saw Stirling hit a six, so in the next over I told Ibrahim to put mid-off back, and bowled wicket-to-wicket. I didn't think about my fifty; I just tried to put a good score for the team." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> <strong>Jonathan Trott</strong>, Afghanistan's coach: "I thought we were a bit short to be honest... but then we saw the wicket slow down. With two new spinners, it's important in a series like this that we perform well. [Against] Sri Lanka, we didn't play the cricket we know we can. It was important we came back in this series and did well. It's important we don't get too far ahead of ourselves; cricket is a great leveler." <strong>10.10pm</strong> Ireland lose 8 for 26 in a staggering collapse, as what was 93 for 2 in the 22nd over turned out to be 119 all out after 35. The ball was turning for Nabi and debutant Kharote, with a few skidding through sharply too. It wasn't easy for a new batter to start on this slow pitch, and Ireland's batters departed one after the other. As a result, Nabi got his maiden ODI five-for 15 years after his debut, and Kharote finished with four in his first game. Hang around for the presentations.
