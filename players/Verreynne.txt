massive appeal for lbw from Siraj. He thinks the batter had shuffled too far across. Initially excited by the appeal, Rahul is unmoved as <strong>Rohit asks if if they need to review that. </strong>.

Thanks, Shashank. What a start for India. Can Prasidh and Mukesh build on it? For now, Siraj is bowling his seventh in a row

given lbw! But Verreynne has gone upstairs - he has to. Was a full ball, pitching around off and angling towards the pads. It beat Verreynne on the flick and hit the front pad. And the ball-tracking shows it would have missed the leg stump
