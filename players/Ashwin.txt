OUT! {"short": "caught", "long": "c sub (PWA Mulder) b Rabada", "commentary": "Ravichandran Ashwin c sub (PWA Mulder) b Rabada 8 (11b 2x4 0x6 13m) SR: 72.72"}
<b>Wow, Rabada generates trampoline bounce</b>. Unplayable stuff. Good overhead catch from Mulder. On a length, angling in and rears up at Ashwin who tries to loosen his grip. But the ball hits the glove/handle and pops up to third slip, where the sub fielder snags a smart catch
