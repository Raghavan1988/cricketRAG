Sagar Uprety: "If you are never in, in these conditions, why not play the Bazball way? Sure its a risk of being bundled cheaply, but also can work out. In the end, you have to win a series, so it can work out in more innings than not. "

Ashwin is OUT! caught
c sub (PWA Mulder) b Rabada
Ravichandran Ashwin c sub (PWA Mulder) b Rabada 8 (11b 2x4 0x6 13m) SR: 72.72
<b>Wow, Rabada generates trampoline bounce</b>. Unplayable stuff. Good overhead catch from Mulder. On a length, angling in and rears up at Ashwin who tries to loosen his grip. But the ball hits the glove/handle and pops up to third slip, where the sub fielder snags a smart catch
