After I got out, thought 85-90 might be a good score, the way it was sticking in  the wicket, but Bairstow and Brook a good partnership. Class players, not much time in the middle but they created something. We've had two games rained off in England and the Scotland game, but we've done all we can do." For one night only, an Australia fan? "Absolutely..." <B>Harry Brook is Player of the Match</B>: "There was a lot of anxiety going around. Thankfully it stopped and we got a game. We took a bit of information from batting, Toppers started beautifully with his height. It was tough against the big boys. Facing spin in the middle was tough, didn't know how it would come out of the pitch, plinking into the gap for twos so I was knackered. But Jonny was banging it, he batted beautifully." Kaleem : "So what if Scotland Vs Australia is washout " Scotland would go through with the extra point <B>5.56pm</B> And breathe. England were pushed right to the limits of their campaign there, not so much by Namibia but by the weather, albeit David Wiese with ball and bat did his utmost. For three hours it seemed any hope of play was futile, but the skies cleared, and do too did England's mindset, after a distinctly hairy Powerplay on a sweaty Antigua pitch. England finish with a net run-rate of 3.61, so that's not going to be a factor. It all comes down to St Lucia, and whether Scotland can do a number on Australia. If they can, they fair play to them. They will vault into the Super Eight at England's expense. Hari Sankar A: "Wiese should keep going on for at least the next two years with a hope of Namibia qualifying for T20WC 2026" He'd certainly be worth his place, but all signs are that he's done now...
