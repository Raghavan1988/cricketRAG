fired into the blockhole, Kaleem tries to clamp down on it. The ball skids through to Rizwan past leg stump. There was half an appeal for caught behind but I think it flicked the pad

nails the yorker, 139kph/86mph and dug out to mid-off... who sets himself and has a shy, misses! So a single off the final ball, and Canada have scraped together something from the depths of 55 for 5
<b>12.05pm:</b> Forecaster reckons Pakistan are a 93% chance from here. I only wish I had that sort of confidence. They've done a decent job with the ball, nevertheless, and certainly the efforts of Aaron Johnson (52 off 44) made this look like one of the better surfaces we've seen at Nassau County. Anyway, while the Pakistan fans bite their nails during the break, you can see what Urooj Mumtaz and Niall O'Brien think on Time:Out, then join Vish Ehantharajah for the chase Here's Johnson: "My mentality is always to get the team off to a good start and be positive. The coach tells me, see the ball and hit the ball. [Pakistan quicks] It was tough but I have some Caribbean background. The team want me to face the pace and I relish the opportunity. [Defendable?] Our bowling attack has been doing well for the last six months so hopefully we can get across the line."
