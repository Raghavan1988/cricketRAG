Alzarri will now have Starc to bowl at. More short stuff to follow?
Starc is OUT! caught

<b>Got him!</b> Starc has nicked off! Length ball on off, just going away. Starc with a nothing poke gets an outside edge and Joshua Da Silva does the rest. And West Indies will go to <b>tea</b> a happy team
<b>6.45pm</b> A balanced session, this one, with Mitchell Marsh starting Australia's counterattack and then after he fell to Alzarri Joseph, it was Alex Carey who came in and played a blinder. He got a bit of luck early on, with the bail not coming off despite Shamar Joseph hitting the top of off when he was on eight. But he went on to smack 65 off just 49 as he and Khawaja added 96 runs off just 99 balls. But West Indies ended the session well, with Shamar having Carey caught in the deep and Alzarri getting Starc to edge one behind. West Indies still very much on top, and they will be bowling to the lower order under the lights. Join Alex in a bit for the third session, which should be an interesting one.

Tom: "Is this Australian team really a juggernaut?" Hard to not call them that! Especially at home! Only India have managed to win a Test in Australia in recent times, let alone series.

Starc faces more short stuff, this one going away from him though. He has his bat up in defence and drops the ball to the off side

Aseem: "AussieBren, you have a big heart. Really appreciate your love of Test Cricket."

Dug in back of a length on leg and Starc manages to clip it behind square. Good fielding by Sinclair at the boundary rope, saving three runs there
