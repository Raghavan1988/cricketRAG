Faraz: "I don't know when people will understand, approach of teams change according to the situations and conditions. No team can score 180, 200  everyday on every pitch. Have a look at last 2 t20 world cups in UAE and Australia. And also in this series NZ easily scored 220  on 2 occasions and here they are struggling a little to chase 160." Imran: "What has changed for Pakistan since 2021? This is pretty much the same team since then. Used to be quite competitive and actually could have won both T20 world cups (2021 and 2022)." Donald Alexande: "I must say Pak fans are pretty tough on their team!!!! Great comeback by Haris Rauf after Finn Allen butchered him in Dunners"

Placed and timed beautifully! Takes on the short ball and pulls it away with disdain to square leg boundary and finishes the game in style! New Zealand lead the series 4-0
That's it from our ball-by-ball coverage. Do check the match report. For now, It's goodbye from <strong>Rvel Zahid</strong> and the rest of the crew at ESPNcricinfo. Thank you for your feedback throughout the game and keep enjoying this amazing sport! <strong>Shaheen Afridi, Pakistan Captain</strong>: I think they way Rizwan gave us the start, it was very good unfortunately we couldn't grab the opportunity in middle overs. I try to take wickets in the first over, I feel 170 was a good total on this pitch, if we grabbed our chances, we could have won this game <strong>Mitchell Santer, New Zealand Captain</strong>: They have managed their chase extremely well like they always do, credit to Shaheen, he bowled amazingly upfront. We knew the new ball might do a little bit and that made it challenging up the top. For Phillips to come out and build a partnership like that and to finish it off we'll take that for sure. We were able claw back in the end, credit to JP and Daryl for the way they went about it, if you get used to the pace, you kind of cash in. New Zealand register a comprehensive win after a stutter early on, as Shaheen Afridi snapped up three wickets in his opening burst. However, Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips carried out great rebuilding work, navigating their way through choppy waters to emerge on top once again. Pakistan continues to struggle, facing the threat of a whitewash. Mohammad Nawaz couldn't match the quality of Mitchell Santner in the middle overs and a crucial chance was put down as well. There were far too many loose balls that released pressure at pivotal moments. Once again, Pakistan didn't get any substantial contributions from the middle order, and Mohammad Rizwan was the lone ranger who got Pakistan to a somewhat respectable score on this two-paced pitch. Considerable improvement from Pakistan in bowling, but still, plenty of gaps to fill in. They need a quality spinner in the middle overs to apply the squeeze, and the pacers need to fine-tune the execution of their change-up deliveries and yorkers. It has become a recurring issue for Pakistan to slip up from strong positions, let's see if they can get a consolation win on Sunday

NZ came into bat afterwards so frustrated and demoralised they collapsed for 76 all out. Let's hope they can do better this time."

<strong>cleans him up with an absolute corker!</strong> Floated up deliciously on a fullish length on middle and off. Drifts into Mitchell, which makes him think he can go over Motie's head. Drops on him late, though, and then rips past the outside edge, knocking back off stump. Mitchell cannot believe what has happened, but he has to walk back. West Indies continue to tighten their grip on this game!

<B>smashed up and over long-on!</B> A big yahoo to finish, he didn't get hold of it, but it plugged out of reach of mid-on tracking back, and back they come for the winning second run
<B>2.40pm</B> So, that's a wrap from Trinidad. New Zealand are eliminated at the group stage for the first time in their T20 World Cup history. Afghanistan and West Indies face off later tonight. From Miller, Vish and Thilak, good night! <B>Kane Williamson</B>: "Turning up and trying to execute on this surface was about hitting an area, chasing was a bit of a grind but got across the line. At any tournament you want to start strong, adapting faster would have been important. A number of guys in our side will be around for a long time and they will be better for this experience, and these surfaces. I think after every tournament there's a bit of reflection, this being Trent's last ICC tournament, great servant of our game and the world game. Sad to see him go but that's the nature of playing for a long time. As a guy, he's got such a big appetite to keep getting better, trains hard, v fit, and v clear with how he wants to operate. Held him in great stead across formats. Sticks his chest out and performs well. A fantastic contribution, and has created the space for new players to come in." <B>Assad Vala</B>: "A lot of learnings to take away from this tournament. Adapting quickly to the wickets, and the pace of the bowlers, we found challenging, we found a way, trying to give our best every time. We believed we could improve some areas, a bit in the wicket and they exploited it well. Some were rolling along the ground, we tried to adapt as best we could. With the World Cup, what we have done over the past month, a lot of people watching cricket back home. Not sure what's next, the World Challenge League in Kenya will hopefully improve us in the future." <B>The Player of the Match is Lockie Ferguson</B> for figures of 4-4-0-3... wow. "A tough wicket to bat on, nice to bowl on that, sad to be leaving, such high hopes coming in. Not many games you bowl seam-up all the way through. Wicket offered assistance, swing as well. Hard to know on these wickets what's a par total, we bowled well v Afg and WI, but going down there ruined our World Cup. The crowds have been amazing, a party all the time." <B>2.22pm</B> Handshakes all round as two campaigns come to an end. New Zealand go home with regret, PNG with some pride after a battling display in the field. They made their South Pacific neighbours battle harder than might have been anticipated, especially after Lockie Ferguson made history with four consecutive maidens. In the end, Conway's 35 from 32 got their chase going, before Williamson and Mitchell sealed it. Morea was excellent for his 2 for 4 in 2.2 overs.
