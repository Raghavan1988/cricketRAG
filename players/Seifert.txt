araz: "@ MNK. Pakistan strength in T20's was always bowling. Sorry to say we are a very average bowling unit without naseem shah at the moment. As far as chasing 200 plus scores goes, its not Pakistan cup of tea with a very inconsistent middle and lower order. We are still relying on Babar Rizwan and Fakhar to cross us over the line, everyone else are just filling up numbers as far as batting goes." Faisal: "Rauf must learn from Wasim Jnr. he mixes deliveries so well. " Ar: "200ish is chaseable in NZ due to the small ground sizes. Pakistan can't lose too many wickets in a hurry like they have throughout the series."

Tim Seifert c Saim Ayub b Mohammad Wasim 31 (23b 3x4 1x6 56m) SR: 134.78
<strong>That's a well-directed slow ball bouncer on off, </strong>he goes for the big shot and hasn't quite got all of it. Tries to get on top of that short ball, rolls his wrists, looking ungainly and Saim Ayub hangs onto it brilliantly at deep midwicket, came in a few steps and then settled under it beautifully. He has only made 31 because Allen took most of the strike, but Seifert did his job well, sometimes it's best to keep man on fire on crease

<strong>squealing for an lbw</strong>, chat going on, tossed up fuller and straightens towards middle stumps line as he looks to reverse sweep, he might have gloved it. Well, the ultra-edge shows no deflection to me as it passes the gloves. The third umpire says no deviation as confirmed by the snicko. Pitching outside off, impact line and hitting middle stump so that's a brilliant review, excellent captaincy to have a meeting, it was certainly worth another look. Time Seifert's struggling innings comes to an end, he was trying to get a move on here but Iftikhar is quick through the air and seldom gets off his line which begs the question, where was he in the previous four games?

Naseem played entire PSL season, surely any random international match holds more value than franchise cricket matches. Also they all played no cricket in last month and Naseem is coming back from an injury, needs to get some game time. He is a Test bowler, i am sure he can manage 4 overs spread out in different phases. " Badar: "A very warm welcome to you Rvel. I was hoping to see you at the com tonight, glad I got my wish. What's your say on a player like Usman who excelled as an opener in PSL but now asked to bat in the middle? " Thank you. The top-order has numerous options which poses a problem for the management. I think he will be able to adjust and make full use of the opportunity. His approach is straightforward; likes to take the game head-on and puts batters under pressure and can change the complexion of the game in a matter of few overs Areeb: "Stop playing Naseem against weak sides in fringe matches!" Khan: "Seems like we're going to see the trilogy (Amir, shaheen and naseem) quite early today. The only problem is it'll be pretty hard for Amir to book a ticket for the t20 World Cup. I don't see him replacing hairs Rauf in anyway" <strong>Azam Khan</strong> is ruled out of the series. He has been advised a 10-day rest following radiology reports confirming a grade one tear of his right calf muscle Azam will now depart from the Pakistan men's cricket team and report to the National Cricket Academy, where he will commence his rehabilitation process under the supervision of the PCB medical panel. The discomfort in Azam's right calf was first noticed during batting practice in the pre-first T20I training session at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. Pakistan are unchanged Karachi Khatmal: "@Shafiquechimie, that is what Azhar Mehmood hinted in his press conference that After top 3 everything will be decided based on the score and conditions." Majid Bhatti: "Before this squad, people used to make a combination of batting order of Pakistan line up. However this time around, even people find it difficult to make a batting order. " Mujahid : "I think Imad should be included in playing 11, this is the stage set for the management to try different combinations." Shafiquechimie: "Imo, Babar's greatest headache is to sort out his and Rizwan's batting order. With inclusion of Saim and Usman, this debate has heated up even further.Babar should open with Saim and then everything should be fluid, next batter comes in based on the wicket fell." As we wait for the toss and team line ups, let's take a look at this match preview by <strong>Danyal Rasool</strong> where you can find all the key discussion topics <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/pakistan-finally-gear-up-for-some-cricket-after-plenty-of-off-field-turmoil-1429613">Pakistan finally gear up for some cricket after plenty of off-field turmoil</a> <strong>6:45pm:</strong> It's a beautiful summer evening at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium and weather is clear for a full contest. Once again, fans have come in large numbers in hope of a cracking contest <strong>6:37pm:</strong> Toss and line-up imminently. Stay tuned <strong>6:30pm:</strong> Howdy cricket fans and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of the second T20I of the five-match series between Pakistan and New Zealand from Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. I'm Rvel Zahid and will be your eyes and ears for this game. Only two balls were possible in the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/pakistan-vs-new-zealand-2024-1424827/pakistan-vs-new-zealand-1st-t20i-1424829/match-report">series opener</a> as rain played spoilsport. Weather forecast is clear for the day, so it's safe to expect an uninterrupted game After an excruciatingly long wait and rain playing hide and seek throughout the day, we could only watch two balls of action as rain had the final say, and the series opener was eventually abandoned. But we did see signs of old Shaheen with that scrumptious booming inswinger that breached Tim Robinson's defense. Early to speculate, but the manner in which Shaheen was stripped of captaincy, he will have that extra kick to prove a point and get back to full throttle. There are many things to be sorted for Pakistan and there's not much time left for the World Cup. The batting order has to be figured out after the addition of Saim Ayub and Usman Khan, and Pakistan is yet to find their best 11. It will be a stern challenge for yet another new management to block the external distractions and align all energies to focus on the World Cup, which is less than two months away. On the other hand, New Zealand are without several of their mainstays owing to the ongoing IPL, and a couple of injuries have created an opportunity for the fringe players to strut their stuff. Despite a depleted squad, New Zealand will spare no effort to give Pakistan a run for their money. Taking into account the chaos and frequent changes in PCB's higher-ups over the last year, the lack of continuity and stability could be exploited to put the hosts under pressure. Babar Azam, with the captaincy armband, will be aiming for a better record in his second stint after a brief hiatus but he will need support from the core to build up well for the World Cup. How do you think both teams are shaping up for the upcoming World Cup? We look forward to your <strong>feedback</strong>

Minty: "Disagree with Khan saying he can't see Amir replacing Rauf - his experience in the CPL makes him quite desirable. Management will probably bring both and keep a rotation policy among the 4 main pacers to manage workload."

Tim Seifert c Shadab Khan b Shaheen Shah Afridi 12 (10b 1x4 1x6 10m) SR: 120
Is it a plane? Is it a bird? No, it's Shadab Khan with a <strong>stunning catch at backward point</strong>, swoops to his right and dives forward to take a brilliant catch. That was pitched on a length on an awkward off-stump line, he hurriedly pushed at it and the ball popped up, Shadab hunted it down in a jiffy. Super stuff! A massive breakthrough for Pakistan!

Seifert responds with the bat and strongarms a pull shot through square leg for a four, right out of the meat of the bat, stamps his authority on Amir, it's been phenomenal striking from the swashbuckling opener!

Around the wicket, short of a length, came in a shade, not much room to free his arms, he stepped to the leg side and can only punch it back to the bowler, Amir gives him a stare

He was shimming down leg and Amir saw him and bowled it far wide of off, he leapt like a tiger jumping across off to put some bat on it but can't connect, remarkable effort nevertheless, evolved into a tiger for a moment that's latching onto its prey

Just got a bit carried away! Slightly shorter and drifts in at middle and leg, he yanks his front foot away to slog that into the stands but lost his control, bottom-hand came off and he ends up dragging it back onto the stumps. Pakistan are over the moon; they've got the big fish! Will this open the floodgates?
