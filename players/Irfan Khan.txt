Irfan Khan is OUT! retired hurt
retired hurt 
Mohammad Rizwan retired hurt 22 (21b 1x4 0x6 32m) SR: 104.76
Bowls full and gets some sideways movement on a nettlesome off-stump line, played down the wrong line and Foulkes finishes the over with a dot, New Zealand have done well to keep them to a decent total, it's not that imposing but still good enough on a tricky surface
<strong>Update on Mohammad Rizwan:</strong> "Mohammad Rizwan felt discomfort in his right hamstring while batting. As a precautionary measure, the medical team has pulled him out of the game. He will not take part in the rest of the match." Pakistan finish with 178/4, thanks to the much-needed impetus from Shadab Khan, who scored a quickfire 40 off 20 balls. Will it be enough? It will depend on how New Zealand's elder statesmen respond. New Zealand need to have a solid powerplay to keep the equation manageable and the likes of Mark Chapman, Tim Seifert and James Neesham will have to step up to the plate. Pakistan found it tough to keep the scoring rate high, and both Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan couldn't go berserk after getting a start
