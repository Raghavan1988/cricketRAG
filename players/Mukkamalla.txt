Mukkamalla is OUT! caught
c Aarif Sheikh b Karan KC
Saiteja Mukkamalla c Aarif Sheikh b Karan KC 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0
<b>Mukkamalla edges to slip for a golden duck!</b> Gem of a delivery on the fourth stump channel gets Mukkamalla prodding forward. Healthy edge carries low to Aarif Sheikh at first slip who juggles this initially but holds onto it in his lap while falling backwards.
Karan KC will be on a hat-trick to start the fourth over. Reminder that Monank Patel would usually be batting at No. 3 for USA but is out today with illness which forced the teenager Mukkamalla to be bumped up to No. 3 from the middle order to try to fill in for Monank's absence.

Saiteja Mukkamalla b Klein 10 (12b 0x4 1x6 18m) SR: 83.33
<strong>Mukkamalla bites the dust!</strong> Full delivery just outside off stump that pitches and nips back in sharply. Mukkamalla, perhaps confident after the drive off the last ball, has a waft again. This time, though, his bat face closes, leaving a gap between bat and ball. The ball zips through it and smashes into the stumps!
