Kusal Janith Perera is the new batter

And Ngarava goes up for leg before! But is this too high? Umpire thinks so, but Raza is convinced to go upstairs. This one jagged back from a length. It's struck Perera above the knee roll on the back pad. And it's a decent shout, but the impact on the wickets is umpire's call as it's only clipping the bails

Spilled by backward square leg! Perera leathes this sweep, but the man in the ring gets both hands to it to his left but can't hold on

<strong>that looks dead straight, and the umpire agrees!</strong> Googly on a length just outside off. Perera gets down on one knee and slogs across the line rather wildly. Only connects with fresh air and gets rapped on the back leg. <strong>Perera chats with his partner and then opts to review. Not sure this is a great review. No bat involved, and Ball Tracking has the ball thundering into the middle of middle stump. Perera has to go, and takes a review along with him too!</strong>
