Binura Fernando comes in

Soumya's been given out caught behind off the bottom edge, but he's reviewed immediately. This was a back of a length ball that jagged in off the pitch (Left-armer Binura is coming over the wicket to the leftie batter). Sarkar plays a big pull but it's not quite short enough for the shot he's playing and there seems to be a nick as it goes through. Ultra edge shows a spike, but the third umpire thinks that there is gap between bat and ball when the spike shows up. <strong>Sri Lanka are not happy!</strong> Soumya Sarkar was actually walking out of the field having seen the spike on the big screen. But as far as the TV umpire saw it, the spike came one frame too late for it to be an edge off the bat. Sri Lanka have swarmed around the on-field umpire (who initially gave it out and then had to change his decision), to get answers. It all depends how well the ultra-edge is calibrated, but we usually see those given out no problem.

Tossed up half-volley outside off, bludgeons straight through the hands of Aaron Jones at extra cover and finishes the game with a boundary
With a 2-1 victory for the home team, that concludes the Bangladesh vs USA series. Your presence has been enjoyable to us throughout the series. We appreciate you tuning in. I, Rashad, on behalf of Sudeep, Thilak, and the entire crew signing off. Goodbye, good night, and take care. Abdullah: "How do you call BD Big team, Jawad? " <strong>Aaron Jones: </strong> "Obviously, we had a bad game today. I think that we didn't assess the conditions as good as we should. But so it goes sometimes. Kudos to Bangladesh for a great win today. I think there's a bit of shot selection (didn't go our way). We obviously played at this ground a lot. We know that sometimes it's tough to bat first. I just think it's coming down to our shot selection, we have played poor shots. (Warm up games) Definitely important. I think right now we are still trying to get the combination going into the World Cup. So those two games (Warm Up) are going to be very important for us. (Against Canada) Yeah, we are definitely confident. I think we have a pretty strong team and obviously we have the extra confidence right now mentally. So just about playing good cricket and go back to the drawing board and play our best cricket, and hopefully we will come on top." <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto: </strong> "Alhamdulillah (For today's win). I think the boys showed a lot of character today. I think the plan we made before this match, everyone executed our plan. It's very disappointing for us (Losing the series). We didn't play well to be very honest. But we finished on a high note and I think this confidence going up to the World Cup will help us and we know all the condition and all those things. So we experienced all those things. If we go to the World Cup with those experiences then it will help our team." <strong>Player of the Match and Player of the Series Mustafizur Rahman: </strong> (Shanto translating) "Alhamdulillah he (Mustafiz) is very happy. I think where he bowled he was very happy. He tried a lot of variation and mix it up. That's what he does. Today others didn't do all those things. (Winning the POTS and POTM award) He feels very good." Jawad: "Well, Big teams lose and learn. Pak lost to Zimbabwe once, Eng to Neds, and so on. The only thing that matters is learn from the mistakes, not repeat them " This is the first time Bangladesh won a T20I match with ten wickets in hand. Finally proving themselves in the series, Bangladesh's top order won the match and finished the series 2-1. It was a fitting way to wrap up the tour. Soumya got 43 runs off of 28 balls, and Tanzid scored his third T20I fifty. A convincing victory will give the visiting team confidence and positives heading into their World Cup warm-up matches. In this hot and muggy weather, a couple of hundred people came to the ground to watch the game, giving Bangladeshi supporters something to finally celebrate. <strong>Bangladesh won the match by 10 wickets</strong>
