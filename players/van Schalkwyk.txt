Wide yorker outside off, jabs and edges it back to the keeper, completes a quick single
With the first partnership of 44 runs, the USA team got off to a strong start. Then, they had to start the innings over after Rishad took two wickets in a row. After Aaron Jones departed, the batters were unable to speed up and change the strike.  Patel struck 42 off 38 balls.  Bangladesh bowled well today, executing nicely in the latter overs with the slower deliveries. Mustafizur, Rishad, and Shoriful each took two wickets. Join us again in 10 minutes for the chase. <strong>Bangladesh requires 145 runs to win the match</strong>
