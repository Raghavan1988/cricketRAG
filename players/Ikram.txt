Another solid forward defence, and with that they head to <B>tea</b>
<B>2.41pm</b> A session apiece then, as Sri Lanka comfortably take the post-lunch session. Three wickets and 78 runs in it, but crucially they have seen the back of Rahmat Shah, who was dismissed for 91 courtesy an outstanding piece of work behind the stumps from Sadeera Samarawickrama. Two wickets inside the first hour had left the visitors muddled, but a 45-run stand between Shah and Ikram had seen them consolidate before Sadeera intervened. Abhimanyu will be with you in about 15 minutes or so for the day's final session.

ahh, hints of Suresh Raina in that inside-out loft after coming down the track. Avishka at long-off runs and dives to his right to cut it off, but replays will be checked to confirm if it's a for or not. Yup, I think he is. His right knee is touching the rope as he pulls the ball back. Anyway, Dananjaya went full and outside off, as Alikhil came down to loft it with the full face of the bat, almost squatting on his back knee

<strong>ahh, bowled him!</strong> But hang on... Alikhil isn't sure, and hangs around for the umpire to confirm. The umpire will check with his TV colleague. Yup, the front-on angle does indicate that he is bowled, which is confirmed by the side-on angle. This is what happened: Alikhil was hanging deep in the crease, and Wellalage went on a length around eighth stump. The ball turned back in rather sharply, and cramped him for room as he looked to slash last moment, perhaps surprised by the good turn. But he was late on to the shot, and the ball whisked past his bat and bat to hit the middle of off stump
