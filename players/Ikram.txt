<strong>gets him with a fuller length now!</strong> Not quite full per se but much fuller than the previous ball. Alikhil, after seeing the ball whistle past him the previous delivery, is caught on the crease and pokes at it without any footwork. Feathers it through to de Kock, who pouches a smart, low catch. Coetzee has his second, and Afghanistan are in a lot of trouble now!

<strong>that was sharp, but that is also four!</strong> Bumper on middle and off, that just climbs through. Alikhil gets into an awkward tangle but does well to sway out of the way. The ball keeps gathering pace and de Kock, behind the stumps, cannot get anything behind it
