Kumara to start things off. Over the wicket to Mehidy. <B>12.41pm</b> The players are back out in the middle, we're almost underway. Chaminda: "Really confused how estbalished batter are getting out one by one and the nihgt watchman is there sitting pretty. Is he having charmed life or playing really well?" --- He's had a few fortuitous moments, but in general think the fact that he's aware of his limitations has ensured he's remained patient against the good deliveries. Riyad_Shuvo: "With Taijul still going strong, am I the only Bangladeshi who fancies Gillespie's famous double hundred from here? Both came to the pitch previous day as nightwatchman!" --- Not just the only Bangladeshi Riyad, probably the only person anywhere, ever. But I do love the optimism. <B>12.35pm</b> Welcome back folks, hope everyone's had themselves a hearty lunch. Bangladesh will be hoping to replicate Sri Lanka's batting dominance from the second session yesterday, but the question is, can a someone offer *checks notes* <em>Taijul</em> support?
