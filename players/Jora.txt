<strong>almost!</strong> Hard length on middle and leg. Sticks in the surface and Jora closes his bat face too early. Pops up off the leading edge but does not quite carry to Tanzim. A wicket-maiden for the Bangladesh quick - his second in succession

Jora is OUT! caught
c Rishad Hossain b Tanzim Hasan Sakib
Sundeep Jora c Rishad Hossain b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 1 (8b 0x4 0x6 13m) SR: 12.5
<strong>four for Tanzim, and he has caused mayhem tonight!</strong> Short and wide outside off, very similar to the ball that got Paudel. Jora tries to keep it down but is unable to do so. Hits it straight to Rishad, who makes no mistake. Tanzim is delighted, and why shouldn't he be. He has turned this game Bangladesh's way, almost single-handedly!
