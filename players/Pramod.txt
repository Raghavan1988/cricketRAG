<B>Madushan is reprieved! Lbw given, but Sri Lanka review. This was tossed up on middle and leg and Madushan fails to connect with the sweep. He's struck on the front pad. And it's a good review! Ball tracking says this was turning down past leg stump

<B>Oh dear, collision near point! But the catch is taken!</b> This was sliced in the air, and Anamul and Jaker Ali circle under the ball with no communication with each other. The former takes the catch and holds on, but not before crashing into Jaker, who is left sprawled on the ground
The stretcher is back out as Jaker lays flat on his back. Hopefully he's okay. Jaker was on the pitch as a sub himself.
