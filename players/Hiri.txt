<strong>and Naveen among the wickets straightaway!</strong> Length outside off. Comes back in with Naveen's natural angle and Hiri, like he did last over, tries the expansive square drive. The inward movement does not make that stroke feasible and all he does is chop it back onto his stumps. PNG four down now, and in a lot of trouble!
