back of a length outside off. Slapped down the ground to long off and Bangladesh crawl up to 122, which is well short of the 182 India put up in the first innings!
<strong>2:15pm</strong> That will be all from us for this warm-up game. Hope you enjoyed our coverage just as much as we loved bringing it to you. This was just the appetiser, though. The main course begins in about six hours from now, with co-hosts USA taking on Canada. Do join us for that game, but until then, this is goodbye from Thilak and me (Shashwat). Take care, folks! <b>Rohit Sharma, India captain:</b> Quite happy with how things went. Pretty much got what we wanted from the game. Like I said at the toss, it was important to get used to the conditions. New venue, new ground, drop-in pitch - important to get used to it and we managed pretty well. (On Pant batting at No.3) Just to give him an opportunity. We have not really nailed down what the batting unit will look like. Even the bowlers did pretty well. All in happy, happy with how things went. (On Arshdeep) He has shown us, in whatever games he has played, he has the skills up-front. He has got a very good skill-set (at the death too). We saw it today. He bowled pretty well, swung the ball up front, and then bowled one at the back end. We have got 15 good players here. We have to see what the conditions are and then see what combination is best for us. <b>Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh captain:</b> The bowlers did a great job, the way Shoriful bowled and the way Rishad bowled - really happy. We did not do well with the batting but I hope we will do well in the tournament. We are not thinking about what has happened before. We know how capable we are, we have to be brave and execute our plans. Taskin and Fizz are very important for us, when they come back, it will be a different ball game. He (Shoriful) is in observation, he will probably be fine. Everyone is very excited to play the first match but we have to be calm. <b>2:05pm</b> A comprehensive victory and a satisfactory outing for India, it must be said. Almost all of their bowlers rolled their arm over, and almost all of them did a decent job. Arshdeep was the pick of the bunch, his new-ball scalps rocking Bangladesh early. Siraj then got the better of Tanzid, before Axar got into the act. Hardik bagged a wicket too, with Dube finishing with a couple right at the end. As for Bangladesh, well, they never really seemed intent on going after the target, especially after the early wickets. Mahmudullah did his reputation no harm and was the only bright spark in their batting display. Shakib's struggles, in particular, could be a cause of concern, as would be their top order's susceptibility to the new ball. The only good thing for them is that they probably know what needs rectifying ahead of the T20 World Cup, whereas India will be delighted with the time spent in the middle and how their team is shaping up.
