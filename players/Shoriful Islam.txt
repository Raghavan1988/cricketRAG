Slower ball, looks to heave this over long-on but he can't connect. They run the leg bye, but now they need a boundary. Sri Lanka have asked for this review, but this was quite clearly striking almost a foot outside off stump.

<b>Fernando gets Shoriful!</b> Banged in again, and this follows the batter as he backs away. Shoriful swings at it anyway and the ball goes straight up off the splice. Fernando seems to misjudge it initially but then back-tracks smartly to catch it over his shoulder. Third wicket for Fernando, and SL now just a scalp away from bundling Bangladesh out!
