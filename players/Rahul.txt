"How is Sai holding on this testing pitch? I believe he had a very high control percentage before that Hendricks over and seems to be playing the short ball well (thanks Cricinfo for allowing us to "see" without actually watching the game)" Gaurav, he started off really well, but weirdly it seems the ball is actually doing more off the surface after the 10th over. The swing in the air has settled down, but the more challenging aspect is the movement off the surface

short of length on middle and leg, tucked to deep square. <b> That's tea on Day 1 </b> Just gotten a tad darker in the last 30 minutes. Rabada rightfully leads the South Africans off the field.
<b>3.12pm </b> Four wickets for South Africa, 85 runs for India. Little doubt as to which dressing room will be the happier one. Rabada was in menacing form, picking up a five-for to rip through India's batting line-up, including two corkers to dismiss Iyer and Kohli. Rahul's looking good, rock solid but he is in dire need of some support from the lower order. Shardul braved the bowling for a while, coping blows en route a breezy 24 before his resistance ended. How many more can Bumrah & co add with Rahul? Can India edge past 220? Join us in 15 minutes for the final session. For all we know, it could be a sharp and short session. Plenty of overs left and I doubt we'll get them all in. But so much has happened in just 50 overs. Deiva will be back in with the controls shortly.

<b>2.42pm</b> That's tea on the opening day. India are 111 for 4 - not a great score in isolation but given South Africa managed only 55, they must be feeling a lot more comfortable with a lead of 56. Jaiswal fell without scoring before Rohit and Gill took India into lead.
