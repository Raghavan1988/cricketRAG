WI get one but that was near the blockhole and Chase, who tried to swat it over midwicket, could only nick it onto pad and steal a run as the ball dribbled in the infield
Srini: "I think Walsh Jr. / Holder can come in now as an Impact-Sub for Fletcher.... Oh, wait !" Srinidhi won't have have impact subs either, so she'll have to start the chase. <strong>Andile Phehlukwayo</strong>: (Plan to King) He was going well, tough to bowl to with the new ball. Wanted to slow his momentum and it worked. Adapting to the conditions was key. The wicket isn't easy, there is a bit of spin. It does become easier to bat with time. I am backing my skill, tryna play around with the seam and bowling consistently. <strong>3:44pm</strong> Great comeback by SA. Mike Haysman says WI are about 40 runs from where they should have been. Santosh Gautam, in the comments, too is bullish about WI making 210 after racking up 109 for 1 in the first ten but the conditions did change dramatically. The pacers got low bounce, seam movement, and turn with the cutters. It was nothing like the evenness that the new, hard ball provided. King utilised that by going hard in the powerplay and finished with 79 crucial runs. Van der Dussen shuffled his bowlers deluxe and got rewarded only later in the innings. Phehlukwayo was key in the turnaround,  Baartman too picked a three-for. Coetzee was decent at the death but the early push gave WI 175.
