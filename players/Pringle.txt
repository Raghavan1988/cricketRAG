good catch by Markram! He was pretty close in at midwicket, and leapt to take it with a reverse cup. Shorter side of a length from Baartman, as Pringle went pulling at it from middle and leg. He hit it forcefully, but couldn't time or place it all that well, with the ball seemingly rushing off his bat

Pringle has been bamboozled about eight times in his stay so far, can't lay bat on ball. It's because Fizz and co have used the pitch and the slower variation to full effect. Beats another heave with a fullish ball. Keeper didn't collect it and in fact, ball went to short third. Pringle was sent back after looking for the run
Turjo: "No crisp in PRINGLE?" Bangladesh have locked him by the jaw. Can't blame him too much, given he's a bowler mainly

Slower one ends Pringle's misery as well as the game. Leg stump has been floored. Was a fullish length that angled back in. Pringle lunged far forward and tried to heave over midwicket. Missed it and there are big smiles among Shanto, Shakib et al
After low-scoring games in New York, Group A sees a par game in Grenadine. Netherlands should've gotten closer but as Shanto said, Fizz showed his experience and skill and helped Bangladesh seal a crucial 25-run win. Another crucial clash coming up from Group B, where England take on Oman. Our coverage has started, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/england-vs-oman-28th-match-group-b-1415728/live-cricket-score">follow here</a>. Thanks for joining. <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh captain</strong>: Boys showed lot of character in an important match. Shakib's calm and we know how good he is. Happy for him. (Total) We didn't know how the conditions will behave and what score is defendable. In the end batters and bowlers did well. Pitch is good, there was uneven bounce early on but good to bat on. Conditions were good. Fizz, we know how good he is. Showed his experience and skill. Rishad stood up like all the bowlers. <strong>Scott Edwards, Netherlands captain</strong>: We lost in all three facets. Credit to Bangladesh, they were great and we weren't up to it. They kept wickets in hand. Would be tough to bowl to a windy boundary. Stand between him and Sybrand - We knew they had quality bowlers at the death and wanted to maximise the middle overs but fell quickly. Aryan has been sensational in the last couple years and used the conditions well. It's a bit out of our hands now. Want to play well vs Sri Lanka and see how it goes from there. <strong>Shakib Al Hasan, POTM</strong>: It was important for someone from top-four to bat through the innings. Happy to contribute. It was a tough pitch at the start, we held our nerves. Was a challenging total, not a winning one, but bowlers chipped in perfectly. Rishad and Fizz took it away from Netherlands. Hardly any international game was played in the last 4-5 years here. So, we didn't know what a good score was and had to keep wickets till 14-15 overs and take it from there. 160 in a WC game is always tricky. Netherlands had their moments, 10 runs an over on this ground in the last 7-8 overs, wind going in one way, made it tough to defend. But credit to bowlers for pulling it off. Neck braces was for batting and it did help. <strong>2:07pm</strong>: Commanding win for Bangladesh despite the game being tight for about 15 overs of the chase. Gets them in pole position to progress into the Super Eights from this group and knocks out Sri Lanka. Coming into the tournament, they had a few big challenges - death and spin bowling being chief among them. Fizz, Taskin, Rishad have offered them solutions despite the pressure put on them by  proactive batting from Netherlands' top and middle order, who kept chipping in but couldn't carry on. The bowlers worked out that going slow into the pitch as it wore and tore helped them out, and there was no looking back.

stumped! Pringle runs at the bowler, who bowls a quick googly, gets the ball to dip and jive between the bat and pad. The batter is stranded way down the track, and Kusal Mendis cheekily delays the stumping a couple of seconds long enough for Pringle to look back at him. Probably could have just been merciful and sent the batter on his way there, without embarrassing him.
