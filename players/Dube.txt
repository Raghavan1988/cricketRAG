In 2022, I had asked Jitesh Sharma what his batting mantra was. He replied: "Basically, the position in which I bat is a situation-dependent one. The middle order is not an easy place to walk in and score boundaries. You have to be flexible. If I come in in the 19th over, I need to start hitting from the top. If I come in the tenth over, then I have to play long. That's what it boils down to."

Shankar : "@Mani, It is an aberration that built based on his ODI exploits. Rohit's SR is close to 110 in last T20 WC and less than 130 in last 3. He scored at less than 100 in the semis which we lost. He past his prime in T20s. "

That is all from us at ESPNcricinfo from this encounter. Thank you for joining us. See you on Sunday for the second T20I. <B>10.27pm</b> Who is the Player of the Match? Of course it is <B>Shivam Dube.</b> Here he is: "I think it was really cold but I enjoyed playing on this ground. Playing after a long time....batting at No. 4 was a bit of pressure for me but I had one thing on my mind... that I had to play my style of cricket. From my style, I feel a bit of pressure first 2-3 balls but after that I think about the ball and don't think too much. I know I can hit big sixes in T20s, so I know I can get runs anyway. (Rohit chat post game) He said I played really well and that we'll chat to improve my game in upcoming games. (Bowling) Today I got the opportunity and executed what I had to." <B>10.21pm</b>Time for the presentation.<BR><BR><B>Ibrahim Zadran, the losing captain:</b> We were short 13-15 runs. We lost the toss too. But the boys fought well. We were trying to have a good powerplay start but we lost wickets then. One of us should've gone for 14-15 overs but we lost back to back wickets. When new batters came, we came under pressure. (Fielding effort) In the second innings there was dew and gripping of the ball was difficult. I can say that the boys tried really well. (Other areas of improvement) We will try to improve our fielding. We were quite lazy with the fielding today. We will try to improve batting as well. Bowling we have no issue.

Wasn't the easiest of conditions but our spinners bowled particularly well. (Angry after getting out) Honestly these things happen. When it happens you feel frustrated because you want to be out there and score runs for your team. Wanted Gill to carry on. He played a good innings but got out. Lot of positives - Shivam Dube, the way Jitesh batted, Tilak as well and obviously Rinku. (Next game?) Want to try  a few things. Want to make the bowlers do a few different things.

Making it a habit of staying not out. Enjoyed batting in the cold a lot. While fielding the ball was hurting and nobody could see much out there (laughs). I try to talk to myself, and tell myself that anything can happen when I bat at No. 6. In the last IPL, I spoke to Mahi bhai, and he said the more you remain calm the better it is. Try to see what the bowler is doing and react accordingly.

Dube finishes unbeaten on 60 to round off a memorable day that also saw him bowl a tidy spell of 2-0-9-1.<BR><BR>The game, though, was set up by the India bowlers.

Elsewhere, with the Pro Kabaddi League at the midway point of the season, it's time to hand out grades to each franchise. Which team scored an A+ and could Telugu Titans be anything other than an F?

India need 19 off 24. The management would like to see how these two get these 19 runs. Do they finish it off in 18? Or do they do it Dhoni-style in the 20th over?

good length ball sits up. Punched to long off for a single. Rinku considers two but then turns it down
Shankar : "@Mani, It is an aberration that built based on his ODI exploits. Rohit's SR is close to 110 in last T20 WC and less than 130 in last 3. He scored at less than 100 in the semis which we lost. He past his prime in T20s. "

That is all from us at ESPNcricinfo from this encounter. Thank you for joining us. See you on Sunday for the second T20I. <B>10.27pm</b> Who is the Player of the Match? Of course it is <B>Shivam Dube.</b> Here he is: "I think it was really cold but I enjoyed playing on this ground. Playing after a long time....batting at No. 4 was a bit of pressure for me but I had one thing on my mind... that I had to play my style of cricket. From my style, I feel a bit of pressure first 2-3 balls but after that I think about the ball and don't think too much. I know I can hit big sixes in T20s, so I know I can get runs anyway. (Rohit chat post game) He said I played really well and that we'll chat to improve my game in upcoming games. (Bowling) Today I got the opportunity and executed what I had to." <B>10.21pm</b>Time for the presentation.<BR><BR><B>Ibrahim Zadran, the losing captain:</b> We were short 13-15 runs. We lost the toss too. But the boys fought well. We were trying to have a good powerplay start but we lost wickets then. One of us should've gone for 14-15 overs but we lost back to back wickets. When new batters came, we came under pressure. (Fielding effort) In the second innings there was dew and gripping of the ball was difficult. I can say that the boys tried really well. (Other areas of improvement) We will try to improve our fielding. We were quite lazy with the fielding today. We will try to improve batting as well. Bowling we have no issue. Will focus on what we did wrong today."<BR><BR><B>Rohit Sharma, the winning captain:</b> It was extremely cold to be honest. Now I am okay.

attempts an inswinging yorker, which takes Dube's front pad as he looked to flick. The ball dribbles away, and India clinch the win
Some terrific hitting from India even as it was a flat pitch, and a ground with short boundaries. The partnership of 92 between Jaiswal and Dube took just 42 balls, as India comfortably crossed the line. Now they have just one last T20I to play, after which comes IPL and then the much-awaited T20 World Cup, for which combinations must be decided quickly. But for now, this is it from us today, as India wrap the series. See you, and take care! <strong>Axar Patel is the Player of the Match</strong> for his 2 for 17 on a batting-friendly pitch: "Feels great to know this double of stats. But it's more important to play and do well for India; I don't think I'll even remember the numbers after a few years! I was trying to bowl for a few years, but there wasn't that confidence earlier... I developed what I needed to do with my action. The confidence has carried forward. I bowl in the powerplay too. It's not that I can bowl only quickly; I can go slow too depending on the pitch. You need to be prepared to be hit. It's about the mindset, though, as you can change your plans. Now I continuously bowl in the same areas, and challenge the batsman to take chances." <strong>Rohit Sharma</strong>, the winning captain: "It's a great feeling [to get 150 T20I caps]. It's been a long journey, starting in 2007. I think we are very clear what we wanted to do and achieve. When you see performances like that, you can feel very proud of it. There's one thing to talk about it, and another to go out and do it. We've ticked almost every box... [Dube and Jaiswal] have had a tremendous couple of years. Yashasvi plays Test cricket and T20 cricket [for India]. He's making full use of the opportunity. And Dube as well - he's got power, and can take down the spinners. We've asked him to do that, and he has played two crucial innings for us." <strong>Ibrahim Zadran</strong> speaks first: "We were quite short. We had a good start in the powerplay... Sometimes we play well in the powerplay, sometimes in the middle [overs], and sometimes in the death overs. We are going for the T20 World Cup, so we don't want to repeat these. Gulbadin is the most senior guy in the team; we trust him. He played very well." <strong>Time for the presentations</strong> Niroop: "I wonder how India are going to fit Surya, Hardik and Jadeja into this team when they come back" <strong>Shivam Dube</strong>: "I think the skipper is really happy with my performance. We both (Jaiswal and him) are stroke players. He was batting really well. We had a plan that both will be going, so let's finish the match as soon as possible. There wasn't any target [to finish], but we've finished on time! There are many things I have worked on. It's not about skill [only]... being focused on every ball is important. I am working on my bowling as well. Last match was good; this match wasn't on my bowling side. But T20 is like that" Manu: "IPL will answer many such questions" <strong>10.01pm</strong> A crushing win for India, who also take the series. Incredible aggression by Jaiswal and Dube to set this up, with the 173 chase ending with as many as 26 balls remaining. Just note the strike rates here: 68 off 34 for Jaiswal, and 63 from 32 by Dube. Rohit fell in the first over, after which Kohli played an attacking cameo in his first T20I in more than a year. But before all of that, it was Axar Patel's economical stuff which restricted Afghanistan. Hang around for the presentations.

Drills a very full ball down the ground. Long-on runs across and stops it with a dive. Looks rough on a sandy outfield, that allows time for the batters to take two and help India complete the win
That's it from New York in this tournament. It's been a hurry, a bit of a mess but the low-scoring games have helped us reacquaint with a different genre of thrillers after the IPL. India are though. USA can make it as can Pakistan, but the weather is also a concern for the latter. For today, there is another game - a biggie from Group C - with West Indies taking on New Zealand. Hope to see you for that. I'm Ekanth, signing off for now on behalf of Andrew Miller (comms), Thilak Rama and Chandan Duorah (scoring). <strong>Rohit Sharma, India captain</strong>: We knew it was going to be a tough task, scoring that many. Credit to us for chasing it down. SKY and Dube did well in the end. Lot of the US guys, we've played together. Happy with their progress, saw them in MLC too. They're hard-working guys making a mark. We knew our bowlers had to take the lead as scoring is tough on this pitch. Arshdeep started off magnificently. We want options with us. As and when we feel like we could use them, we should be and that's what Dube allowed. Being in the Super Eight is a big relief. Playing here wasn't easy, could've been anyone's game. Had to stick till the end and take the game as deep as possible. SKY showed he's got a different game and that's what you expect from experienced players. Partnership with Dube was crucial. <strong>Aaron Jones, USA captain</strong>: 10-15 runs short. We know if we'd gotten 125-130 it'd have been a tough total. Boys were disciplined today, pleased that the game got close. Support definitely good. We've wanted fans, talked about it for a couple of years. We'll come hard against Ireland for sure. (Not bowling spin) The wicket was tricky to face seam bowling. So, thought they were the best option. Monank is most likely to be fit for the next game, he just has a niggle. <strong>Arshdeep Singh, POTM</strong>: Very happy with the performance. Last two games I gave away too many but team has kept backing me. Wicket is helpful for pacers, we're getting seam movement so we had to hit the right lengths and let the pitch help out. Here, you can use the wicket more at the death. You can back your execution with yorkers, Bumrah told me as well, to surprise batters. You need to have routines before the game starts, trying to keep it single and follow through every day. All bowlers have done well, looking forward to the same in the next stage as well. Sohum T: "So, a tedious escape for India. They will be happy to leave NY. If we have a full match on Saturday, maybe a run-fest." <strong>2:01pm: India have now qualified for the Super Eight stage</strong>. They'd be delighted to have middle-order bats scrap through to a win. They were pushed by Netravalkar's early blows. SKY and Pant looked to rebuild. The latter was starting to look good but fell to a shooter. Dube joined SKY and both of them often struggled but took singles when they can and didn't mind not connecting with the big shots, which they went for every now and again. The boundaries didn't come by and the asking rate was nearing 8 RPO with last six-odd overs left. But a couple of boundaries brought it back. USA's pacers kept them in but a penalty cost them with four overs to go, and SKY got a couple of boundaries that effectively sealed the game. Shoutouts to USA's pacers, Ali Khan for using the pitch well, van Schalkwyk for his variations and Jasdeep for bowling heavy balls. Anderson, despite lacking pace, was disciplined.

<strong>taken beautifully by Mahmudullah on the fence!</strong> Mahedi shortens his length after noticing Dube advance. The change in length does not allow Dube to get the power he wants on the stroke. Slaps it flat towards long on, where Mahmudullah initally leaps to his right to catch it. He then realises he will hit the ropes and does the juggling act, completing it with utter conviction. Brilliant bit of fielding, and Dube's struggle comes to an end!

<strong>this is right out of the screws!</strong> Floated up full outside off and Dube finally finds his range. Goes through the line rather than across and blasts it over long off!

<strong>Dube continues riding his luck!</strong> Back of a length just outside off. Dube goes after this too but does not get any shape behind the stroke. Shanks it and luckily for him, it lands right in between the keeper and the bowler on the leg side

Over the wicket to Dube

<strong>dropped, oh dear!</strong> Flighted up full outside off. Dube winds up and swings at it with all his might. Gets it right off the toe-end and deep mid wicket is very interested. Gets into a good position too but the ball slips through his hands. Rishad the guilty party
