<b>6.31pm</b> Paul Stirling and Andy Balbirnie walk out to open as the Zimbabwe fielders take their positions. Richard Ngarava has the new ball. One slip in place. Here we go! <strong>6.25pm</strong> Hello everyone! And thanks Suds. I think it'll be real interesting how Zimbabwe respond after their recent setback! Anyway, the teams are lining up now for the national anthems. Right, not long before we get underway. Abhimanyu will get things started soon. Hello, Abhimanyu! What are you most looking forward to tonight? <strong>6:21pm</strong> Raza wanted to chase under lights and hence opted to bowl first. Talks about the new entrants in the Zimbabwe unit playing domestic cricket and hence not really rusty. Wants to start the series well for the home fans. Stirling, on the other hand, wanted to bowl first as well but is looking forward to bat. They have had a lot of indoor training and had a brief camp in Spain, he says, and is confident of them doing well with the T20 World Cup to build up to. <strong>6:19pm Pitch report</strong>: The whole surface has been relaid. There are plenty of cracks on the pitch and there is a little bit of grass left to bind the surface. It is dry and could aid spin. <strong>6:05pm</strong> ZImbabwe have won the toss and <strong>opted to bowl</strong> <strong>Zimbabwe</strong>: T Marumani, W Madhevere, S Williams, S Raza (capt), R Burl, C Madande (wk), B Bennett, L Jongwe, R Ngarava, B Muzarabani, T Gwandu <strong>Ireland</strong>: P Stirling (capt), A Balbirnie, L Tucker (wk), H Tector, C Campher, G Dockrell, M Adair, G Delany, B McCarthy, C Young, J Little <strong>5:50pm</strong> Zimbabwe and Ireland have won six matches apiece out of the 12 they have played against each other. They played a bilateral series in Harare at the start of this year with ZImbabwe taking the series 2-1. This series, however, will be an interesting one to follow. Ireland are part of the T20 World Cup 2024 that Zimbabwe missed out of. But their last T20I assignment was in August against India, where they showed the fight and yet lost. Will they be rusty or will the Stirling-led side find their mojo immediately? How will the Sikandar Raza-led home team do under lights for the first time at home? <strong>5:35pm</strong> Ireland have left out allrounder Fionn Hand and legspinner Ben White from the squad that played India in August this year. Making their return to the side are fast bowler Graham Hume and wicketkeeper-batter Neil Rock.This is also the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/zim-vs-ire-white-ball-series-graham-hume-neil-rock-part-of-ireland-s-t20i-squad-for-zimbabwe-series-1407913">first series</a> since Paul Stirling was appointed as the full-time white-ball captain. <strong>5:25pm</strong> A few new faces for ZImbabwe following their failure to qualify for the T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies. Middle-order batter Brian Bennett and fast bowler Trevor Gwandu have received call-ups with experienced fast bowler Tendai Chatara and left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza among the names that miss out. More on that <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/brian-bennett-and-trevor-gwandu-called-up-in-zimbabwe-squad-for-ireland-t20is-1411637">here</a>. <strong>5:15pm</strong> Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of the opening match of Ireland's tour of Zimbabwe. Three T20Is followed by three ODIs to be played. I am S Sudarshanan and will have Abhimanyu Bose's company throughout as we bring you all the updates. The Harare Sports Club will don a different look this evening, courtesy the newly installed floodlights. This is the first-ever night international at the venue and after Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the men's T20 World Cup 2024, it will be like a literal light at the end of the tunnel.

<b>6.31pm</b> Paul Stirling and Andy Balbirnie walk out to open as the Zimbabwe fielders take their positions. Richard Ngarava has the new ball. One slip in place. Here we go! <strong>6.25pm</strong> Hello everyone! And thanks Suds. I think it'll be real interesting how Zimbabwe respond after their recent setback! Anyway, the teams are lining up now for the national anthems. Right, not long before we get underway. Abhimanyu will get things started soon. Hello, Abhimanyu! What are you most looking forward to tonight? <strong>6:21pm</strong> Raza wanted to chase under lights and hence opted to bowl first. Talks about the new entrants in the Zimbabwe unit playing domestic cricket and hence not really rusty. Wants to start the series well for the home fans. Stirling, on the other hand, wanted to bowl first as well but is looking forward to bat. They have had a lot of indoor training and had a brief camp in Spain, he says, and is confident of them doing well with the T20 World Cup to build up to. <strong>6:19pm Pitch report</strong>: The whole surface has been relaid. There are plenty of cracks on the pitch and there is a little bit of grass left to bind the surface. It is dry and could aid spin. <strong>6:05pm</strong> ZImbabwe have won the toss and <strong>opted to bowl</strong> <strong>Zimbabwe</strong>: T Marumani, W Madhevere, S Williams, S Raza (capt), R Burl, C Madande (wk), B Bennett, L Jongwe, R Ngarava, B Muzarabani, T Gwandu <strong>Ireland</strong>: P Stirling (capt), A Balbirnie, L Tucker (wk), H Tector, C Campher, G Dockrell, M Adair, G Delany, B McCarthy, C Young, J Little <strong>5:50pm</strong> Zimbabwe and Ireland have won six matches apiece out of the 12 they have played against each other. They played a bilateral series in Harare at the start of this year with ZImbabwe taking the series 2-1. This series, however, will be an interesting one to follow. Ireland are part of the T20 World Cup 2024 that Zimbabwe missed out of. But their last T20I assignment was in August against India, where they showed the fight and yet lost. Will they be rusty or will the Stirling-led side find their mojo immediately? How will the Sikandar Raza-led home team do under lights for the first time at home? <strong>5:35pm</strong> Ireland have left out allrounder Fionn Hand and legspinner Ben White from the squad that played India in August this year. Making their return to the side are fast bowler Graham Hume and wicketkeeper-batter Neil Rock.This is also the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/zim-vs-ire-white-ball-series-graham-hume-neil-rock-part-of-ireland-s-t20i-squad-for-zimbabwe-series-1407913">first series</a> since Paul Stirling was appointed as the full-time white-ball captain. <strong>5:25pm</strong> A few new faces for ZImbabwe following their failure to qualify for the T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies. Middle-order batter Brian Bennett and fast bowler Trevor Gwandu have received call-ups with experienced fast bowler Tendai Chatara and left-arm spinner Wellington Masakadza among the names that miss out. More on that <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/brian-bennett-and-trevor-gwandu-called-up-in-zimbabwe-squad-for-ireland-t20is-1411637">here</a>. <strong>5:15pm</strong> Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of the opening match of Ireland's tour of Zimbabwe. Three T20Is followed by three ODIs to be played. I am S Sudarshanan and will have Abhimanyu Bose's company throughout as we bring you all the updates. The Harare Sports Club will don a different look this evening, courtesy the newly installed floodlights. This is the first-ever night international at the venue and after Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the men's T20 World Cup 2024, it will be like a literal light at the end of the tunnel.

A big gap at cover! <strong>2.50pm</strong> Right then, the chase is about to be underway. Paul Stirling and Andy Balbirnie will want to do better than they did yesterday. Can Zimbabwe's bowling attack minus Sikandar Raza and Sean Williams defend 140? We will find out soon. In the mean time you can let me know what you think will happen!

Short of a length, and slightly wide of off from Naveed, as Balbirnie poked at it to Rahmat at third slip, who leapt a little. The ball popped up and went behind him, as Ibrahim from second slip kept his eyes on it, but the ball was still beyond his dive

Afghanistan are celebrappealing, and it is given out lbw. Balbirnie consults his partner, and <strong>reviews at the last second</strong>. Fuller side of a length on off from Naveed, as it came back in to hit Balbirnie low on his front pad. The impact seemed to be on middle and leg, as he was beaten on the inside edge while looking to flick. Yup, ball tracking confirms that the ball would have hit the middle of leg stump.

Farooqi has the new ball for Afghanistan. One slip for Balbirnie. <strong>7.59pm</strong> The umpires walk out, before Rashid has some final words of encouragement for his side. Ireland's openers Balbirnie and Stirling follow, stretching and swinging their arms in drill. The national anthems ring out to awaken a quiet anthem, with Ireland singing theirs first. Afghanistan follow with theirs, and we get closer to the action. "Happy to see Rashid Khan back in action. BTW, the ESPNcricinfo predictions voting system is a great feature. Thumbs up!" --- Thanks for that, Hefaz! <strong>7.48pm</strong> Tino Mawoyo says it is a <strong>used pitch</strong>, and is one where teams should prefer to bat first.

He announces <strong>debuts for Kharote and Ahmadzai</strong>. <strong>7.15pm</strong> Hello everyone, and welcome to the T20I series between Afghanistan and Ireland. The one-off Test went Ireland's way - it was their first win in the format - before Afghanistan hit back to win the ODI series 2-0. In an encouraging bit of news for the hosts, their captain and trump card <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/afg-vs-ire-rashid-khan-set-for-comeback-after-back-surgery-1424951">Rashid Khan is set to return</a> to action. A back injury - and then a surgery - has kept him out since the World Cup last November, but Afghanistan will be boosted by his recovery, given the T20 World Cup is less than three months away. Hang around, as are barely 15 minutes away from the toss.

Farooqi has the new ball for Afghanistan. One slip for Balbirnie. <strong>7.59pm</strong> The umpires walk out, before Rashid has some final words of encouragement for his side. Ireland's openers Balbirnie and Stirling follow, stretching and swinging their arms in drill. The national anthems ring out to awaken a quiet anthem, with Ireland singing theirs first. Afghanistan follow with theirs, and we get closer to the action. "Happy to see Rashid Khan back in action. BTW, the ESPNcricinfo predictions voting system is a great feature. Thumbs up!" --- Thanks for that, Hefaz! <strong>7.48pm</strong> Tino Mawoyo says it is a <strong>used pitch</strong>, and is one where teams should prefer to bat first. However, he headlines that it has historically been a low-scoring pitch. <strong>Ireland</strong>: 1 Paul Stirling (capt), 2 Andy Balbirnie, 3 Curtis Campher, 4 Harry Tector, 5 Lorcan Tucker (wk), 6 Neil Rock, 7 Gareth Delany, 8 Mark Adair, 9 Barry McCarthy, 10 Josh Little, 11 Ben White <strong>Afghanistan</strong>: 1 Rahmanullah Gurbaz, 2 Ibrahim Zadran, 3 Sediqullah Atal, 4 Azmatullah Omarzai, 5 Mohammad Nabi, 6 Mohammad Ishaq (wk), 7 Rashid Khan (capt), 8 Ijaz Ahmadzai, 9 Nangeyalia Kharote, 10 Naveen-ul-Haq, 11 Fazalhaq Farooqi <strong>7.33pm</strong> So the news is that <strong>Afghanistan win the toss and bowl</strong> first. Rashid Khan says he expects dew later, and so chooses to bowl first. He announces <strong>debuts for Kharote and Ahmadzai</strong>. <strong>7.15pm</strong> Hello everyone, and welcome to the T20I series between Afghanistan and Ireland. The one-off Test went Ireland's way - it was their first win in the format - before Afghanistan hit back to win the ODI series 2-0. In an encouraging bit of news for the hosts, their captain and trump card <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/afg-vs-ire-rashid-khan-set-for-comeback-after-back-surgery-1424951">Rashid Khan is set to return</a> to action. A back injury - and then a surgery - has kept him out since the World Cup last November, but Afghanistan will be boosted by his recovery, given the T20 World Cup is less than three months away. Hang around, as are barely 15 minutes away from the toss.

he starts with a full delivery swinging into the batter, and finishing on middle. Clipped just wide of mid-on to get off the mark

Ends the over on a high! That's a rapacious loft for six over deep midwicket and it goes all the way! These timely boundaries are working like a charm for Ireland. Will this go down the wire? 99 required in 10 overs with eight wickets in the tank! Game-on!

Fakhar and Babar can open the batting with fakhar as the aggressor and Babar as a sort of semi aggressor. Then should come Usman, then Mohammad Haris instead of Rizwan and then Saim ayub. I think this would work out so nicely for Pakistan. I don't think many would agree with omission of Rizwan but I personally see him as a long format player and I think many would agree he is very good in those formats"

Shaheen Afridi is ready to start the proceedings Pukhraj Saxena: "I am living 7 miles from Clontarf Stadium and its really bright and sunny here - hopefully game should start soon." <strong>3:33pm:</strong> It has got brighter again and covers are coming off Pakistan team is in a huddle, we're all set for the start. First ball at <strong>3:40pm</strong> local time Players are ready to step in and are just waiting for the covers to be completely removed. By the looks of it, we'll have a start very soon <strong>3:26pm:</strong> I hate to break it to you but just as the players were about to come onto the field, rain has made an appearance again and the umbrellas are up. So frustratingly, <strong>we'll have another delay</strong> <strong>3:30pm:</strong><strong> Pakistan have won the toss and elected to bowl</strong> <strong><u>Teams</u></strong> <strong>Pakistan:</strong> Babar Azam (c), Saim Ayub, Mohammad Rizwan, Fakhar Zaman, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir Mohammad Amir comes in place of Shadab Khan <strong>Ireland:</strong> Paul Stirling (c), Mark Adair, Andrew Bilbirnie, Curtis Campher, Gareth Delany, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker (wk), Ben White, Craig Young Barry McCarthy has a back spasm and isn't playing today Attiya: "Line up is good. Obvio 4th pacer will either be replaced by rauf or spinner but which spinner? Abrar or shadab. Becoz bowling wise, abrar is jey but shadab rightnow provides better batting depth but beliw par bowling. And why didnt try usman for this series to check his game." Mashfi: "Want to say congratulations to Aidan Seaver, who has recently been included in ICC umpires' international panel and is making his umpiring debut today in men's internationals" Safeer: "Pakistan needs to focus on their six hitting percentage and middle overs strike rate, this positive shift in their intent will take them to the next level " Safeer: "Keep faith in the team Pakistani fans, it's Pakistan vs India final at the World Cup :)" Nauman: "I am guessing Shadab is "rested", not "dropped". I gotta ask, what's the update on Haris. If he can't play, shouldn't we be testing that his replacement Hasan? Or are we saying we gonna feed Abbas Afridi to the wolves now and then take both Haris and Hassan to WC at his expense?" <strong>2:57pm:</strong> Good news! <strong>Toss is scheduled at 3:15pm</strong> local time and the <strong>match will start at 3:30pm</strong>. We haven't lost any overs which is great! Decent crowd building up as Ireland's bowlers practice. Haris Rauf and Abbas Afridi are inspecting the pitch and there's plenty of routine activity happening before the match. It seems it was a passing shower as the ground appears dry and fit to play. Just a few minutes until <strong>toss</strong> tarek: "Shadab is pretending to be a big hitting batsman and has lost his ability to be a spin bowler.  Not everyone can be a Narine. Was too costly in the last T20." <strong>2:52pm:</strong> The <strong>rain has stopped</strong> and the covers are being removed <strong>2:30pm:</strong> The toss has been delayed due to rain. We'll keep you posted with all the updates Nauman: "It's a shame that there is so much uncertainty match-over-match. I am all for experimenting, rotation, workload management but we had 1.5 years for that. This whole shift with inclusion of Imad, Amir, Abrar, Irfan, Usman, Salman at the last minute in squad is where I find the issue. Not saying they are bad or don't deserve. But it's unfair to expect so many new guys come in perform miracles when the established stars are fading for no good reason." khan: "strange of mohammad zeeshan to say abrar has a place in the team especially at the expense of shadab. shadab has been the main cause of pakistan success be it ct17 or t20 wc 22. you cant just remove a matchwinner because of one handpicked performance. pakistan should have faith in their players instead of searching for too much new blood." Hira Wahla: "The production quality is deplorable...  a big factor for not being excited about the match .... well that and the fact that Pak lost the first game" Ateeq: "Pakistan needs to improve their bowling attack. Specifically, Shaheen Afridi should understand that everyone knows his bowling strengths and that he will look for that early inswinger. Muhammad Amir is a good option. Hope for the best" Misba: "Salman Ali agha  should must be included in playing 11 because he performed well playing in middle order,playing with 5 openers Babar,Rizwan , Saim, fakhar,Usman Khan is not working for Pakistan." GormintAunty: "Spending the time alternating between refreshing for updates for a match start time here and refreshing the CS Season 15 page for the drop of the latest song. Wonder which will happen first..." What do you make of the late additions in the squad of <strong>Hasan Ali</strong> and <strong>Salman Ali Agha</strong>? Imran: "Hasan Ali has lost his touch, there are enough better bowlers in Pakistan to replace him. Salman Ali is good to have, should get opportunities." Muhammad Zeesha: "Don't think Hasan or Salman Agha will be in the WC squad. We already have 4 fast bowling options and the inclusion of Usman Khan makes sure Salman doesn't get a crack. mohsin shah: "We are reaching 180s in T20 which imo is good enough, issue has been babar azam blunders in bowling he doesn't rotate properly against NZ and ireland between overs 6-13 he stuck with imad and shadab/usama mir thats not the way to operate in modern t20. A captain having 7 bowling options can't operate like this. Matches in USA might be high scoring but not in West indies cause of slowness of pitches. " Mashooque Ali : "Good evening from beautiful city of Pakistan Attock. Hope today Pakistan win the match Faisal Khawaja: "I think the Pak 11 should be: Babar,saim, usman, rizwan, shadab, ifthikhar, irfan khan,  imad, shaheen, amir naseem" Muhammad Zeesha: "Shadab has been Pakistan's biggest concern. Time for him to make way for Abrar." Aariz: "Here is my perfect XI for Pak: Babar, Fakhar, Usman, Saim/Haris, Rizwan, Irfan Niazi, Iftikhar, Shadab, Shaheen, Amir, Naseem.  This is in the order that they should bat. Thoughts on it?" Naveed: "Looking at the rate at which the other teams are hitting sixes in the power play, Pakistan are nearly 12 runs short of other teams. If Pakistan do not hit a six instead hit a four, they loose 2 runs. If other teams teams say hit 6 sixes in the powerplay and if Pakistan hit 6 fours, instead, they loose 12 runs in the powerplay and this is what happening in most of the matches. " SalmanKhan: "Let's not just fall into false hope. PCT needs to fix major problems which imo are: 1. Improve spin department, 2. Improve middle order strike rate, 3. Stabilise top 3 positions and define each players role onwards.And most importantly, NO AZAM KHAN and SHADAB KHAN till WC is over." Hassan: "@ummer- Pakistan will be playing t20 series against best t20 side and current world champions in 10 days time. " Hamid: "I believe it is always important for Pakistan to lose a match against a weak opposition for them to get back to the track. They lose against one weak team, and they win all the next matches. Being Positive." Kam H: "Pakistan had a good run in previous two T20 world cups, but even then they failed to show an aggressive approach needed to lift the trophy. It seems like Pakistan's cricket is still stuck in 2022 mindset while whole world has moved into much evolved T20 cricket in 2024." Imran: "Pakistan usually starts things in a chaotic fashion, then some sense is thrown in and the team clicks and find ways to end up doing rather well. All that talk about current Pakistan team scoring too slow, not taking enough wickets will go out of the window midway WC, that's when Pakistan do a Pakistan and turn things around as only Pakistan can. So sit tight and enjoy the ride, it will be rough and bumpy, but rewarding all the way. Ummer: "I think Pakistan faces multiple issues. They are lagging behind in T20 cricket which may be due their bilateral series either with minnows or B teams. Pakistan haven't played their bilateral series  against best teams like India " Mustafa Moudi: "Ireland had defeated Pakistan in the 2007 World Cup which was hosted by West Indies. This year too the T20 World Cup is scheduled to be hosted by West Indies. So its safe to say Pakistan must avoid facing Ireland whenever West Indies is hosting any World Cup !!" Nauman: "People forgetting that Pakistan has always been like this winning against any opposition no matter how strong and losing against even the weakest ones Abdur: "How is the weather?Is it going to be raining?" There is a good chance for rain disrupting the game and about a 50% chance of thunderstorms in the next few hours so fingers crossed. Let's hope we don't have any interruptions. <strong>2:22pm:</strong> On the other hand, Ireland doesn't need to complicate anything; they should go about their business in a free-spirited style in their backyard, as they did in the first T20I. They produced a stunning performance, especially with the bat, with Balbirnie leading the way. Harry Tector and George Dockrell put Pakistan under pressure with their pyrotechnics, and their approach towards chasing down the target was superb. Ireland's bowling attack will add further balance with the addition of Joshua Little, who will join the squad for the World Cup. They are shaping up well for the big event and have a history of springing surprises and pulling off major upsets. Expect more of the same from Ireland. As for Pakistan, we can expect them to bounce back now that they have had some time in Ireland after an extended period of playing at home. However, the question remains whether they'll look to score quickly throughout the innings and not leave all the heavy lifting towards the end. The tourists will require a more disciplined bowling performance. Mohammad Amir will be available for selection today, and his addition will certainly strengthen the pace attack, given his fair amount of experience playing in similar conditions. Saim: "Pakistan has never been the same ever since the hammering by India in the Asia Cup. I look to that day as when the team's downfall began and they've never recovered." We can't underscore the importance of psychological factors in any competitive sport. Without grit and resilience, athletes tend to crumble under pressure, and maintaining a strong mindset is pivotal to success at this level. Pakistan didn't have the most memorable year, starting with the Asia Cup, followed by the ODI World Cup in India and a couple of bilateral series. But now it's time to start anew, leaving all the emotional baggage behind and focusing on the T20 World Cup. One aspect of the game that Babar could improve is his game assessment and tactics. After the first match, he mentioned they were 10 runs short of par and couldn't finish well. Instead of having a specific total in mind and a par score before the game, why not aim to post imposing totals and push your limits? GormintAunty: "First time in a long time I don't really feel that excitement before a Pak match. This last year has to be one of the worst in Pakistan cricketing history and that's saying something given our past. Although I hope its just the darkest before dawn bit and we take the WC by storm. <strong>2pm: </strong> Welcome to Ireland v Pakistan, the second T20I of the three-match series, and ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of the game. I hope it's a walloper of a contest. Pakistan will look to bounce back while Ireland will eye a historic series win. Let's see who's going to win the second tussle. I am Rvel Zahid and I'll bring you the action. I believe that the frequent changes in the PCB, coaching staff, and managerial roles over the past year or so have caused disturbance within the Pakistan cricket team. Perhaps the team is not as cohesive and united as it once was, and we mustn't overlook the importance of the game's mental aspects. The constant chopping and changing, the sudden axing of Shaheen Afridi after just one series against New Zealand has seemingly affected the team's environment Top athletes must develop a thick skin when competing at this level. Regardless of what has transpired with the captaincy changes and other distractions, the focus must shift to the upcoming World Cup. In the last game, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ireland-vs-pakistan-2024-1426828/ireland-vs-pakistan-1st-t20i-1426830/match-report">Andrew Balbirnie's bold onslaught</a> deflated Pakistan. It's becoming increasingly common for Pakistan to get deflated when facing a strong counter-attack, especially while defending scores. The same happened last month when Mark Chapman went berserk in the third T20I at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. There have been issues with the batters' strike rate. Pakistan used to rely on a particular winning method: the opening pair of Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam would set a platform, albeit often at a lower strike rate, but the team would post middling totals, and then the bowling would usually bail them out of trouble. However, the bowling arsenal is not as potent and consistent as it used to be. The bowling lacked the kind of discipline that we saw in the 2022 World Cup. The percentage of full tosses, half-volleys, and missed wide yorkers was higher in the last game, which invariably released all the pressure. Shadab Khan, in his current form as a bowler, is not providing the stability that Pakistan expects from an experienced bowling all-rounder. Abrar Ahmed could be a much better wicket-taking option, and he is capable of bowling in the powerplay. What do you think?

Shaheen Afridi is ready to start the proceedings Pukhraj Saxena: "I am living 7 miles from Clontarf Stadium and its really bright and sunny here - hopefully game should start soon." <strong>3:33pm:</strong> It has got brighter again and covers are coming off Pakistan team is in a huddle, we're all set for the start. First ball at <strong>3:40pm</strong> local time Players are ready to step in and are just waiting for the covers to be completely removed. By the looks of it, we'll have a start very soon <strong>3:26pm:</strong> I hate to break it to you but just as the players were about to come onto the field, rain has made an appearance again and the umbrellas are up. So frustratingly, <strong>we'll have another delay</strong> <strong>3:30pm:</strong><strong> Pakistan have won the toss and elected to bowl</strong> <strong><u>Teams</u></strong> <strong>Pakistan:</strong> Babar Azam (c), Saim Ayub, Mohammad Rizwan, Fakhar Zaman, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir Mohammad Amir comes in place of Shadab Khan <strong>Ireland:</strong> Paul Stirling (c), Mark Adair, Andrew Bilbirnie, Curtis Campher, Gareth Delany, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker (wk), Ben White, Craig Young Barry McCarthy has a back spasm and isn't playing today Attiya: "Line up is good. Obvio 4th pacer will either be replaced by rauf or spinner but which spinner? Abrar or shadab. Becoz bowling wise, abrar is jey but shadab rightnow provides better batting depth but beliw par bowling. And why didnt try usman for this series to check his game." Mashfi: "Want to say congratulations to Aidan Seaver, who has recently been included in ICC umpires' international panel and is making his umpiring debut today in men's internationals" Safeer: "Pakistan needs to focus on their six hitting percentage and middle overs strike rate, this positive shift in their intent will take them to the next level " Safeer: "Keep faith in the team Pakistani fans, it's Pakistan vs India final at the World Cup :)" Nauman: "I am guessing Shadab is "rested", not "dropped". I gotta ask, what's the update on Haris. If he can't play, shouldn't we be testing that his replacement Hasan? Or are we saying we gonna feed Abbas Afridi to the wolves now and then take both Haris and Hassan to WC at his expense?" <strong>2:57pm:</strong> Good news! <strong>Toss is scheduled at 3:15pm</strong> local time and the <strong>match will start at 3:30pm</strong>. We haven't lost any overs which is great! Decent crowd building up as Ireland's bowlers practice. Haris Rauf and Abbas Afridi are inspecting the pitch and there's plenty of routine activity happening before the match. It seems it was a passing shower as the ground appears dry and fit to play. Just a few minutes until <strong>toss</strong> tarek: "Shadab is pretending to be a big hitting batsman and has lost his ability to be a spin bowler.  Not everyone can be a Narine. Was too costly in the last T20." <strong>2:52pm:</strong> The <strong>rain has stopped</strong> and the covers are being removed <strong>2:30pm:</strong> The toss has been delayed due to rain. We'll keep you posted with all the updates Nauman: "It's a shame that there is so much uncertainty match-over-match. I am all for experimenting, rotation, workload management but we had 1.5 years for that. This whole shift with inclusion of Imad, Amir, Abrar, Irfan, Usman, Salman at the last minute in squad is where I find the issue. Not saying they are bad or don't deserve. But it's unfair to expect so many new guys come in perform miracles when the established stars are fading for no good reason." khan: "strange of mohammad zeeshan to say abrar has a place in the team especially at the expense of shadab. shadab has been the main cause of pakistan success be it ct17 or t20 wc 22. you cant just remove a matchwinner because of one handpicked performance. pakistan should have faith in their players instead of searching for too much new blood." Hira Wahla: "The production quality is deplorable...  a big factor for not being excited about the match .... well that and the fact that Pak lost the first game" Ateeq: "Pakistan needs to improve their bowling attack. Specifically, Shaheen Afridi should understand that everyone knows his bowling strengths and that he will look for that early inswinger. Muhammad Amir is a good option. Hope for the best" Misba: "Salman Ali agha  should must be included in playing 11 because he performed well playing in middle order,playing with 5 openers Babar,Rizwan , Saim, fakhar,Usman Khan is not working for Pakistan." GormintAunty: "Spending the time alternating between refreshing for updates for a match start time here and refreshing the CS Season 15 page for the drop of the latest song. Wonder which will happen first..." What do you make of the late additions in the squad of <strong>Hasan Ali</strong> and <strong>Salman Ali Agha</strong>? Imran: "Hasan Ali has lost his touch, there are enough better bowlers in Pakistan to replace him. Salman Ali is good to have, should get opportunities." Muhammad Zeesha: "Don't think Hasan or Salman Agha will be in the WC squad. We already have 4 fast bowling options and the inclusion of Usman Khan makes sure Salman doesn't get a crack. mohsin shah: "We are reaching 180s in T20 which imo is good enough, issue has been babar azam blunders in bowling he doesn't rotate properly against NZ and ireland between overs 6-13 he stuck with imad and shadab/usama mir thats not the way to operate in modern t20. A captain having 7 bowling options can't operate like this. Matches in USA might be high scoring but not in West indies cause of slowness of pitches. " Mashooque Ali : "Good evening from beautiful city of Pakistan Attock. Hope today Pakistan win the match Faisal Khawaja: "I think the Pak 11 should be: Babar,saim, usman, rizwan, shadab, ifthikhar, irfan khan,  imad, shaheen, amir naseem" Muhammad Zeesha: "Shadab has been Pakistan's biggest concern. Time for him to make way for Abrar." Aariz: "Here is my perfect XI for Pak: Babar, Fakhar, Usman, Saim/Haris, Rizwan, Irfan Niazi, Iftikhar, Shadab, Shaheen, Amir, Naseem.  This is in the order that they should bat. Thoughts on it?" Naveed: "Looking at the rate at which the other teams are hitting sixes in the power play, Pakistan are nearly 12 runs short of other teams. If Pakistan do not hit a six instead hit a four, they loose 2 runs. If other teams teams say hit 6 sixes in the powerplay and if Pakistan hit 6 fours, instead, they loose 12 runs in the powerplay and this is what happening in most of the matches. " SalmanKhan: "Let's not just fall into false hope. PCT needs to fix major problems which imo are: 1. Improve spin department, 2. Improve middle order strike rate, 3. Stabilise top 3 positions and define each players role onwards.And most importantly, NO AZAM KHAN and SHADAB KHAN till WC is over." Hassan: "@ummer- Pakistan will be playing t20 series against best t20 side and current world champions in 10 days time. " Hamid: "I believe it is always important for Pakistan to lose a match against a weak opposition for them to get back to the track. They lose against one weak team, and they win all the next matches. Being Positive."

Hasan Ali comes in place of Naseem Shah <strong>Ireland: </strong>Mark Adair, Ross Adair, Andrew Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Neil Rock, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker (c & wk), Ben White, Craig Young Ross Adair and Neil Rock in for Paul Stirling and Gareth Delany It's a bit overcast so there could be a rain interruption, not that bright out there but let's hope we can sneak in a game and dodge the dark clouds Rashid Hassan: "Evening lads, Usman's place is still in doubt after what Azam portrayed in 2nd T20. Azam has to do hit some more today's and against the English. Usman is still a newbie as we are definitely going in with Saim despite his performance, if He fails, Rizbar, followed by Fakhar, Iftimania and Azam along side both shadab and Imad would do." Rashid Hassan: "I reckon Hassan's gonna confuse the selectors and the fans by taking a four-fer today and making it to the WC squad. " rameez : "Again Hasan ali .

Good evening, we know Saim has a lot of talent and performed well in the domestic setup. I'm in favor of giving him an extended run; he needs more support Joji: "Usman Khan deserved some more chances after what ECB did with him.

Abdul Ahad: "Ireland has the advantage because they got nothing to lose. Pakistan will be under some pressure" <strong>2pm:</strong> Welcome to Ireland v Pakistan, the third and final T20I of the series, and ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage. I hope it'll be a cracking contest. Both teams will be fighting tooth and nail to win this final tussle and bag the series. I liked how Pakistan threw caution to the wind and went bullheaded in pursuit of the chase in the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ireland-vs-pakistan-2024-1426828/ireland-vs-pakistan-2nd-t20i-1426831/match-report">second T20I</a>; that is how T20 cricket ought to be played. Ireland didn't have answers to the onslaught from Fakhar Zaman and Mohammad Rizwan, and a few lapses in the field proved costly. Azam Khan finished it off in style with some big hits. It's the final and anything could happen. We'll bring you all the action from Castle Avenue, Dublin. <strong>Who do you reckon has the advantage today?</strong>

Hasan Ali comes in place of Naseem Shah <strong>Ireland: </strong>Mark Adair, Ross Adair, Andrew Balbirnie, Curtis Campher, George Dockrell, Graham Hume, Neil Rock, Harry Tector, Lorcan Tucker (c & wk), Ben White, Craig Young Ross Adair and Neil Rock in for Paul Stirling and Gareth Delany It's a bit overcast so there could be a rain interruption, not that bright out there but let's hope we can sneak in a game and dodge the dark clouds Rashid Hassan: "Evening lads, Usman's place is still in doubt after what Azam portrayed in 2nd T20. Azam has to do hit some more today's and against the English. Usman is still a newbie as we are definitely going in with Saim despite his performance, if He fails, Rizbar, followed by Fakhar, Iftimania and Azam along side both shadab and Imad would do."
