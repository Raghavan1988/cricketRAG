There's a sound as Levitt slashes, QDK is sure he's been nicked off. Jansen isn't and doesn't appeal. Umpire doesn't give it, SA review. Yep, 'there is a clear spike on the inside edge,' says the third umpire. On-field umpire accidentally signals not out, but Levitt is walking back. So the right decision has been made. Ball was around the fuller side of length and swung in a bit, Levitt tried to go square and the bat was mostly horizontal while lunging on one knee. Feathered it to the keeper

Scott Edwards, meanwhile, says he takes confidence from previous World Cup results against South Africa. <strong>Netherlands are also playing the same side</strong>. And here's confirmation that pitch No. 2 will be used today. Matthew: "@Nalin, as a Kiwi, I wouldn't consider Afghanistan beating us to be a true upset. We brought poor preparation and an unbalanced squad to the WC, and we rightly got pasted for our efforts" Nalin: "Wait... you mention Canada surprising Ireland, but ignore <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-new-zealand-14th-match-group-c-1415714/full-scorecard">Afghanistan upsetting New Zealand</a>!!" --- Ah, I blame the up-and-down timezones for that! <strong>9.50am</strong> We had former South Africa quick Morne Morkel on our expert panel. He says his side <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/t20-world-cup-2024-morne-morkel-south-africa-cannot-expect-to-roll-netherlands-over-1437371">cannot expect</a> to roll Netherlands over, and thinks that the opposition batters <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/t20-world-cup-morne-morkel-netherlands-will-plan-well-against-a-hungry-south-african-attack-1437372">would plan well</a> against a hungry South African attack. So hang tight as we await the toss and the XIs, which are due in just ten minutes. AJ: "Miss Roelof... Always provides a unique energy" Johann Kruger: "SA  will win comfortably today. Netherlands batters don't have what it takes to play the SA bowlers on this type of track" --- If recent history teaches us anything, it is to never underestimate your opponents Mustafa Moudi: "<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/herschelle-gibbs-on-his-six-sixes-at-the-2007-world-cup-i-didn-t-miscue-any-of-them-285651">Herschelle Gibbs' six sixes</a>, Roloef van der Merwe's transfer from South Africa to Netherlands and two back-to-back upsets... South Africa vs Netherlands has so many memories. Hoping for another epic battle between the sides!!" --- And none other than <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/you-see-the-whole-game-situation-in-those-few-seconds-roelof-van-der-merwe-relives-the-catch-of-the-t20-world-cup-1344499">van der Merwe's stunning catch</a> too to turn it around in 2022... <strong>9.40am</strong> <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/netherlands-vs-south-africa-16th-match-group-d-1415716/match-preview">Firdose Moonda's preview</a> sets things up nicely for this morning. Both Netherlands and South Africa have started this World Cup with a win - against Nepal and Sri Lanka, respectively. But conditions at the Nassau County ground could yet suit Netherlands' style of batting. South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen, meanwhile, says <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/klaasen-on-new-york-pitch-batters-need-to-suck-it-up-in-t20-world-cup-1437074">"batters need to suck it up"</a> in New York, even as the pitch seemed a lot more settled yesterday, when Canada played Ireland. Ankur Baid: "If Netherlands beat South Africa today, it should not be called an upset" <strong>9.30am</strong> If <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2022-23-1298134/netherlands-vs-south-africa-40th-match-group-2-1298174/full-scorecard">this game</a> from one-and-a-half years ago, and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/netherlands-vs-south-africa-15th-match-1384406/full-scorecard">this one</a> from eight months back is anything to go by, then Netherlands have become a thorn in South Africa's flesh across World Cups. And if the last two matches in this T20 World Cup - USA shocking Pakistan, and Canada surprising Ireland - prove anything, it is that there are hardly any favourites in the shortest format. Welcome to Netherlands vs South Africa in New York, where cricket could be further in the headlines again.
Pitches it up, swerves it back in from leg stump to beat the flick. Hits pad but that's going down leg, no appeal
