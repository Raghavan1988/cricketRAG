Fans are filling up the seats in New York, with yellow and orange competing for dominance. The teams walk out for their respective national anthems, as bright sunshine continues to bake the city. South Africa's anthem first, followed by Netherlands'. Nikunj: "Netherlands knocked out SA in the last T20 world cup. SA would want some redemption today." <strong>South Africa</strong>: 1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Reeza Hendricks, 3 Aiden Markram (capt), 4 Heinrich Klaasen, 5 David Miller, 6 Tristan Stubbs, 7 Marco Jansen, 8 Keshav Maharaj, 9 Kagiso Rabada, 10 Anrich Nortje, 11Ottneil Baartman <strong>Netherlands</strong>: 1 Max O'Dowd, 2 Michael Levitt, 3 Vikramjit Singh, 4 Scott Edwards (capt, wk), 5 Teja Nidamanuru, 6 Bas de Leede, 7 Sybrand Engelbrecht, 8 Logan van Beek, 9 Tim Pringle, 10 Paul van Meekeren, 11 Vivian Kingma <strong>10.03am</strong> Time for the toss. <strong>South Africa opt to bowl</strong>. Aiden Markram thinks the "wicket looks different" than what it did when they played Sri Lanka. <strong>South Africa are unchanged</strong>. Scott Edwards, meanwhile, says he takes confidence from previous World Cup results against South Africa. <strong>Netherlands are also playing the same side</strong>. And here's confirmation that pitch No. 2 will be used today. Matthew: "@Nalin, as a Kiwi, I wouldn't consider Afghanistan beating us to be a true upset. We brought poor preparation and an unbalanced squad to the WC, and we rightly got pasted for our efforts" Nalin: "Wait... you mention Canada surprising Ireland, but ignore <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/afghanistan-vs-new-zealand-14th-match-group-c-1415714/full-scorecard">Afghanistan upsetting New Zealand</a>!!" --- Ah, I blame the up-and-down timezones for that! <strong>9.50am</strong> We had former South Africa quick Morne Morkel on our expert panel. He says his side <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/t20-world-cup-2024-morne-morkel-south-africa-cannot-expect-to-roll-netherlands-over-1437371">cannot expect</a> to roll Netherlands over, and thinks that the opposition batters <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/t20-world-cup-morne-morkel-netherlands-will-plan-well-against-a-hungry-south-african-attack-1437372">would plan well</a> against a hungry South African attack. So hang tight as we await the toss and the XIs, which are due in just ten minutes. AJ: "Miss Roelof... Always provides a unique energy" Johann Kruger: "SA  will win comfortably today. Netherlands batters don't have what it takes to play the SA bowlers on this type of track" --- If recent history teaches us anything, it is to never underestimate your opponents Mustafa Moudi: "<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/herschelle-gibbs-on-his-six-sixes-at-the-2007-world-cup-i-didn-t-miscue-any-of-them-285651">Herschelle Gibbs' six sixes</a>, Roloef van der Merwe's transfer from South Africa to Netherlands and two back-to-back upsets... South Africa vs Netherlands has so many memories. Hoping for another epic battle between the sides!!" --- And none other than <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/you-see-the-whole-game-situation-in-those-few-seconds-roelof-van-der-merwe-relives-the-catch-of-the-t20-world-cup-1344499">van der Merwe's stunning catch</a> too to turn it around in 2022... <strong>9.40am</strong> <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/netherlands-vs-south-africa-16th-match-group-d-1415716/match-preview">Firdose Moonda's preview</a> sets things up nicely for this morning. Both Netherlands and South Africa have started this World Cup with a win - against Nepal and Sri Lanka, respectively. But conditions at the Nassau County ground could yet suit Netherlands' style of batting. South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen, meanwhile, says <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/klaasen-on-new-york-pitch-batters-need-to-suck-it-up-in-t20-world-cup-1437074">"batters need to suck it up"</a> in New York, even as the pitch seemed a lot more settled yesterday, when Canada played Ireland. Ankur Baid: "If Netherlands beat South Africa today, it should not be called an upset" <strong>9.30am</strong> If <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2022-23-1298134/netherlands-vs-south-africa-40th-match-group-2-1298174/full-scorecard">this game</a> from one-and-a-half years ago, and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/netherlands-vs-south-africa-15th-match-1384406/full-scorecard">this one</a> from eight months back is anything to go by, then Netherlands have become a thorn in South Africa's flesh across World Cups. And if the last two matches in this T20 World Cup - USA shocking Pakistan, and Canada surprising Ireland - prove anything, it is that there are hardly any favourites in the shortest format. Welcome to Netherlands vs South Africa in New York, where cricket could be further in the headlines again.
