There's a sound as Levitt slashes, QDK is sure he's been nicked off. Jansen isn't and doesn't appeal. Umpire doesn't give it, SA review. Yep, 'there is a clear spike on the inside edge,' says the third umpire. On-field umpire accidentally signals not out, but Levitt is walking back. So the right decision has been made. Ball was around the fuller side of length and swung in a bit, Levitt tried to go square and the bat was mostly horizontal while lunging on one knee. Feathered it to the keeper

Thanks, Himanshu. Jansen has the ball. Slip in. Will he find swing? The South Africa players spread around to take their respective positions on the field, and the Netherlands openers follow.

Welcome back folks. So Netherlands have 202 to chase down, against what on paper at least is a very good Sri Lanka attack. They've got to absolutely crush this chase to have a chance of getting to the Super Eights. Levitt and O'Dowd are out there. Mathews - in quite possibly his last T20 WC game - has the ball.

<strong>juuuust clears fine leg!</strong> This is a full ball on the pads and Levitt flicks it, turning his wrists, and making a decent connection. It's going against the wind though, and that brings Pathum Nissanka on that boundary into the game. He leaps and gets a palm to it, but wasn't able to do anything more

Welcome back folks. So Netherlands have 202 to chase down, against what on paper at least is a very good Sri Lanka attack. They've got to absolutely crush this chase to have a chance of getting to the Super Eights. Levitt and O'Dowd are out there. Mathews - in quite possibly his last T20 WC game - has the ball.
