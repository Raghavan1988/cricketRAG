Djoker: "Why have Zim made these changes when ultimately this could all boil down to NRR. They should now try not just to win but to win handsomely as well." The points and/or net run rate from today's result will not carry forward. Only the points and margin/net run rate from the wins over West Indies and Netherlands carry forward because those are the teams also going to the Super Sixes. So today's result is totally meaningless for Super Sixes/net run rate.

Innocent Kaia lbw b Campher 5 (8b 0x4 0x6 5m) SR: 62.5
<strong>Campher traps his man!</strong> It's a length ball on middle and off that straightens after pitching and Kaia can't get bat on it. He is struck in front and Ireland have two quick wickets!
And with that, it will be <b>drinks</b>. And time to welcome Aaditya back to the comms box!

Mark: "A win would do great things for Ireland's morale and, hopefully, indicate better times ahead. For Zim, though, it would be yet another poor result: what can they do to revive their fortunes? One thing, though, that I simply do not understand: why is there no Test match in this tour? Heaven sent opportunity for one between two teams that don't play enough Tests." I am in full agreement about the point on slipping in a Test or two!

Full around off, defended to the off side
