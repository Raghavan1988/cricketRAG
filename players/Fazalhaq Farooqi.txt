That will be all from us, folks. Hope you enjoyed our coverage as much as we loved /bringing it to you. We will be back again in a couple of days' time when these teams clash in the third and final T20I. Until then, this is goodbye from me (Shashwat), Ranjith and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care! <b>Wanindu Hasaranga, Sri Lanka captain:</b> (On the win) Credit goes to the batters. They batted really well. Openers did a good job.
