Full toss almost hits off stump. Just above shin-high, Farooqi was leg side of the ball and tried carving it square. Was a bit too late on it
Mark: "Hi Ekanth, you think that this may be a tricky chase? Do you think that it's a slightly difficult pitch then?" Yes, and yes. But if there is dew and the pitch evens out, like it did in the ODI WC final, might get easier for Ireland.

Hat-trick ball to Farooqi

ahh, and he lands the yorker bang on off. It is jammed back to the bowler's left, though, and they pinch a single
<strong>Josh Little</strong>: "Working closely with the bowling coach to shape the ball back in. The best bowling is both ways. Every time I put on this shirt, I absolutely love it." <strong>9.45pm</strong> Afghanistan were 14 for 4 in the fourth over. Not a lot of punters would have bet then that they would finish on 152, let alone batting out all 20 overs. But Nabi knew only counterattack could help turn the tables. He dominated a 79-run stand with Atal, and eventually smashed 59 from 38 balls. That leaves Ireland chasing a good total, albeit dew could help them. Join us for the chase in ten.

<strong>that will be that! Sri Lanka win by 72 runs and take an unassailable lead in this T20I series!</strong> Length delivery outside off. Farooqi, with his feet stuck to concrete, wafts at it. Does not get it anywhere near the middle and chips it to Shanaka at extra cover, who times his jump to perfection and makes no mistake!
<strong>10:40pm</strong> Right. That will be all from us, folks. Hope you enjoyed our coverage as much as we loved /bringing it to you. We will be back again in a couple of days' time when these teams clash in the third and final T20I. Until then, this is goodbye from me (Shashwat), Ranjith and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care! <b>Wanindu Hasaranga, Sri Lanka captain:</b> (On the win) Credit goes to the batters. They batted really well. Openers did a good job. Sadeera and Mathews finished well to get to a big score. I trust our bowling line-up (to defend these scores). (On becoming the second-quickest to 100 T20I wickets) I have long to go. I trust my variations and I just want to do better. (On changes for the final T20I) I want to test our bench. We have four games left before the World Cup, so I want to have a look at them (those who missed out tonight) as well. <b>Ibrahim Zadran, Afghanistan captain:</b> (On the decision at the toss) I am happy with the decision. We were good till 15 overs but then we gave away lots of runs. We could not execute our bowling plans. We could not execute with the bat either. The pitch was very good. (On their approach in the powerplay) We were trying to have a good start in the powerplay. After powerplay, you can't hit big sixes, so we were trying to make the most of it. No real difference in the pitches we played. It is all about the mind. If you do not execute your plans, you cannot win. <b>Angelo Mathews, Player of the Match:</b> (On how he is feeling) Feeling pretty good. Had a tight hamstring after the last game. Decided to have a fitness test (earlier today) and it all went well. (On his role) Whatever the team wants me to do, I am willing to adapt myself according to the situation. I was struggling a little bit in the first 10-15 balls. Sadeera batted brilliantly as well. That was the plan, for him to bat 17-18 overs. My plan was to have a look and then go for it. His innings helped me a lot, knowing that he was holding one end up. (On the pitch and their bowling performance) It was a very good wicket. We had to bowl good lines and lengths. Our fielding was really good today. Special mention to the Dambulla crowd, they were right behind us. Thank you very much to Dambulla. <strong>10:18pm</strong> A pretty one-sided contest and the writing was on the wall for Afghanistan after the powerplay, where they lost five wickets and their shot selection came under the scanner. Janat and Nabi sparkled but chasing 188, against a highly-skillled Sri Lankan attack, that was never going to be enough. Speaking of Sri Lanka, everything they tried with the ball came off. Mathews set the game up with two early wickets. Theekshana then removed Gurbaz, with Binura's two-wicket fifth over firmly breaking the back of Afghanistan's run-chase. Hasaranga also wrote himself into the history books, becoming the second-fastest to 100 T20I wickets and ensuring that Sri Lanka finished off this game with the minimial of fuss.
