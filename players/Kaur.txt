<strong>Klaas puts it down! South Africa go from bad to worse on the field!</strong> Cross seam delivery, on a length on off stump. Kaur is too early into the drive, it pops straight up to Klaas at head height. She gets there in time but lets the ball burst through the fingers.

<b>4.49pm: </b>Well, after that powerplay, who'd have thought India would get near 300, let alone cross it as emphatically as they have? It was a welcome return to form for their skipper, who scored a brilliant sixth ODI century. That followed another sensational knock from Bengaluru's favourite Smriti Mandhana, who made it back-to-back hundreds at the Chinnaswamy! South Africa will have to bat out of their skins to get this total - which Sampath informs was the <a href = "https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask/cricket-qna/highest-total-for-India-in-India&tournament=wodi" target = "_blank">first time India have crossed 300 in a home ODI.</a> <b>Smriti Mandhana</b>: Cricket has taught us to take nothing for granted. You start from zero. Was important to come out fresh today and do the job for the team. They bowled brilliantly in the first 10-15 overs. I had to change the way I had planned the innings. A lot of seam movement happened, but later the wicket eased out. Maybe something more could happen under the lights. There are a lot of cracks on the wicket, so I'm sure the spinners will get a lot of turn. We'll have to bowl in the right areas and let them make mistakes. Here's more from Sampath: This is India's third-highest total in ODIs. Their EIGHT sixes today is the most they've hit in a single ODI innings. A rather crazy innings split for India as well: First 15 overs - 47/1, 5 fours Next 15 overs - 98/1, 8 fours and 3 sixes 31-40 overs - 62/0, 7 fours Last 10 overs - 118/1, 14 fours and 5 sixes
