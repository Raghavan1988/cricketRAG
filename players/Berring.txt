An important win, we've given ourselves a chance to go through with two more big games to come. Currie's archer celebration, I can't say I'm a fan of it! Good to be out there and get the job done.

It came off.

Namibia's spinners applied a tourniquet through the middle with 3 for 49 in eight overs, but Ruben Trumpelmann's off-day came at a bad time for his side. David Wiese's first two overs for 3 couldn't be matched by his next nine balls, which sailed for 27.

Don't go far away, Gnasher will be here soon to kick off the chase. "It was fun batting out there, good wicket as well," says McMullen. "Most venues here have had a strong breeze so far and that was crucial for us in putting up a good total. So it was a bit of gameplan to hit boundaries with the breeze. Munsey is super aggressive, so I love sitting at the other end. And we play for the same club in Scotland." <B>10pm</b> A good comeback by Australia to concede only 42 in the last five overs after McMullen and Munsey had laid a strong platform. But it's still 180 runs on the board. How the Scotland bowlers use the wind can have a big say in the final result.
