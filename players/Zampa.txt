Eye of Sauron : "Second time in two years that Abbott has scored a half century from no.8 in ODIs. He scored 54 vs India at Indore in September 2023." Second time in two innings for Abbott. Hasn't batted in ODIs in between

slower ball outside off, he lofts this high towards to deep point, they opt not to try for a second run! Probably would have been run out but surprising they didn't try
<strong>5.58pm Innings break</strong> A middling score from Australia. They would have wanted more but it also could have been much worse without a superb innings from Sean Abbott. His 69 from 63 might be the difference in the game. Matt Short played well after coming in under pressure. Will Sutherland also played an important hand with Abbott. Green, Labuschagne and Hardie all made starts but couldn't kick on. West Indies bowled well led by Forde and Motie in particular. Won't be an easy chase though. Australia have seen what lengths they need to bowl. Ekanth will be back for the start of the chase. Shane: "WI still have the greatest chance of winning this one according to SmartStats... will be interesting to see how they fare on this pitch. It was a tricky one to play throughout the BBL and was often two paced and "tacky"" Jrm: "If Australia gets 3-4 wickets in the powerplay they might kill this game in the middle overs, backing abbot to be the mom"

<strong>Thomas drops a sitter!</strong> Slower ball deceives Zampa, he gets under it and pops it up to mid-on, thomas gets under it but completely misses it! That's a bad miss

shapes for the scoop very early! Gets a 99kph, slower ball wide of off and can't lay bat on it

Shot: FLICK

finishes with a boundary...no hat-trick. Gets the line wrong, into the pads, and Zampa flicks wide of short fine leg
Australia have piled up a big total. Overall a very good innings. Was set up by David Warner and Josh Inglis then Tim David helped finish it off after a bit of a middle-order wobble. West Indies weren't great in the first 10 overs but pulled it back a bit before Australia went again. Still, this is a good pitch with some short boundaries - and the wind to help in one direction. Could be a good chase. You'd think Australia's attack will have learnt from the first innings. Alex will be with you shortly
