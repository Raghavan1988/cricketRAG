Very interesting strategy here. Nosthush Kenjige, who batted at No. 9 against West Indies, has been promoted up the order to try to create some breathing room for Gajanand Singh, who made a century against West Indies but is better utilized coming in after the 20th over.

back of a length on fifth stump, Kenjige shuffles across confidently to get inside the line to defend back to Karan.

Kenjige is OUT! caught
c Aarif Sheikh b Karan KC
Nosthush Kenjige c Aarif Sheikh b Karan KC 1 (4b 0x4 0x6 8m) SR: 25
<b>Karan KC is on fire!</b> Shuffles across his stumps fishing at a ball swinging away on seventh stump and pokes at a ball he could have left alone. The movement finds the outside edge and flies low to Aarif Sheikh at first slip, who tumbles to his right taking this in front of his right shin.
So the strategy trying to protect Gajanand for a bit longer does not work. He now has to come in anyway in the 10th over.

Tossed up right up to the toes, plants his front leg and executes the sweep well but finds the fielder at square leg who makes no mistake, shows great presence of mind, sharp throw to Evans at non-striker's end and he quickly whips off the bails to seal the deal for Zimbabwe. They have completely dominated the proceedings and won by the second biggest margin ever in ODIs! Old hand Sean Williams took the game away with a mammoth 174 which was laced with 21 fours and five sixes
Thanks for joining us, peeps. It's time for me, Rvel Zahid, to say goodbye on behalf of Peter Della Penna and Harshith Gowda. We'll see you soon! Zimbabwe have bagged the second biggest win by runs in men's ODIs. They scored their highest total in ODIs surpassing 351 against Kenya and it was also the highest-ever total at Harare Sports Club. They were clinical in all departments of the game and completely outgunned USA in this lop-sided affair, winning by a whopping 304 run-margin as we saw a massive gulf between the two sides. Zimbabwe are on top of their group with eight points and will be riding super high on confidence before entering the all-important Super Six stage. Monank Patel, USA Captain: We haven't played our best cricket and I feel like mentally we need to be strong and come back stronger in the next game. Our batting department has been struggling and we got a few chances dropped otherwise it would have been less than 400 but still I would say lots of learnings from this game. One by one everyone started to get the flu in the last two days. Our main bowlers Ali Khan and Saurabh got the (flu) I think they will recover in a couple of days and I am looking forward to the next game. I think we should be able to play with our best 11 Sean Williams, Zimbabwe Captain: Having the greats of the game around today, Andy and all of you there inspires us. It's very pleasing and obviously having four new players in our team I think it was really good the intensity that they showed from the ball up front was also bang on. I think we have been trying against Pakistan to play with this pattern. All of the guys are starting to slowly fit in and understand the pattern. I think multiple contributions from each and every individual really pleased me. All those small contributions played a massive part. Even in the fielding as well I thought picking up three run-outs in a game is work in the right direction I think we don't have to change much in our game. We have found our momentum and we are looking forward to carrying it. Obviously, it's a different venue, and everything about it is different but still having that crowd behind us is always like having a 12th man. Jaison: "Sean William's won by 70 runs" ZCFOutkast: "Sri Lanka should be fearful of Zimbabwe. As should some of the other sides in the CWC in near similar conditions. Zimbabwe will arguably have one of the most experienced batting orders." Bill: "Spare a thought for Jessy Singh and Paradkar who batted extremely well for lower-order batsmen"

Tossed up right up to the toes, plants his front leg and executes the sweep well but finds the fielder at square leg who makes no mistake, shows great presence of mind, sharp throw to Evans at non-striker's end and he quickly whips off the bails to seal the deal for Zimbabwe. They have completely dominated the proceedings and won by the second biggest margin ever in ODIs! Old hand Sean Williams took the game away with a mammoth 174 which was laced with 21 fours and five sixes
Thanks for joining us, peeps. It's time for me, Rvel Zahid, to say goodbye on behalf of Peter Della Penna and Harshith Gowda. We'll see you soon! Zimbabwe have bagged the second biggest win by runs in men's ODIs. They scored their highest total in ODIs surpassing 351 against Kenya and it was also the highest-ever total at Harare Sports Club. They were clinical in all departments of the game and completely outgunned USA in this lop-sided affair, winning by a whopping 304 run-margin as we saw a massive gulf between the two sides. Zimbabwe are on top of their group with eight points and will be riding super high on confidence before entering the all-important Super Six stage. Monank Patel, USA Captain: We haven't played our best cricket and I feel like mentally we need to be strong and come back stronger in the next game. Our batting department has been struggling and we got a few chances dropped otherwise it would have been less than 400 but still I would say lots of learnings from this game. One by one everyone started to get the flu in the last two days. Our main bowlers Ali Khan and Saurabh got the (flu) I think they will recover in a couple of days and I am looking forward to the next game. I think we should be able to play with our best 11 Sean Williams, Zimbabwe Captain: Having the greats of the game around today, Andy and all of you there inspires us. It's very pleasing and obviously having four new players in our team I think it was really good the intensity that they showed from the ball up front was also bang on. I think we have been trying against Pakistan to play with this pattern. All of the guys are starting to slowly fit in and understand the pattern. I think multiple contributions from each and every individual really pleased me. All those small contributions played a massive part. Even in the fielding as well I thought picking up three run-outs in a game is work in the right direction I think we don't have to change much in our game. We have found our momentum and we are looking forward to carrying it. Obviously, it's a different venue, and everything about it is different but still having that crowd behind us is always like having a 12th man. Jaison: "Sean William's won by 70 runs" ZCFOutkast: "Sri Lanka should be fearful of Zimbabwe. As should some of the other sides in the CWC in near similar conditions. Zimbabwe will arguably have one of the most experienced batting orders." Bill: "Spare a thought for Jessy Singh and Paradkar who batted extremely well for lower-order batsmen"
