gone! Hasaranga down the track to Maharaj straight away trying to bash this one down the ground. But he doesn't get to the pitch of the ball, and although there's not much turn, there's enough to take it away from his shot, and QdK flicks the bails off before Hasaranga can make an attempt at returning to the crease. South Africa are bossing this! Hasaranga's promotion has not worked.

dug in again, another slower ball I think. Gets to chest heigh and Hasaranga goes back and tries to smack it over the offside. Again it comes off the toe, goes high, and is swallowed by by Ibrahim Zadran coming in off the rope at sweeper cover.
Afghanistan got Sri Lanka's openers early, but Kusal Mendis and Sadeera Samarawickrama rebuilt through a century stand. Then it was Asalanka's 97 off 74 that took them over the 300 line. Afghanistan will feel their bowlers did nicely to restrict Sri Lanka to 308 for 6, though. Azmatullah Omarzai was especially impressive, returning figures of 3 for 56 less than 48 hours after completing an ODI hundred in the first ODi. Mohammad Nabi was his usual miserly self, giving away only 38 from his 10. It seems like a pitch on which batting is not particularly difficult. Sri Lanka may need early wickets again. Back soon witht he chase.

<strong>holes out to long on!</strong> Gives it a hint of air and Hasaranga's eyes light up. He steps down, looking to go over long on but cannot generate the elevation he is after. Arrows it straight to his opposite number, who takes it reverse-cupped in front of his face!

Christof: "Leaving it late could come back to bite Sri Lanka. One wicket, a new man at the crease--could quickly collapse on the tail."

c Litton Das b Taijul Islam
Wanindu Hasaranga c Litton Das b Taijul Islam 25 (16b 1x4 2x6 31m) SR: 156.25
Looks to finish it off but departs in the process. Was floated on middle stump, but Taijul had also pulled the length back. Hasaranga looks for a repeat of the previous shot but this time only gets a top edge that balloons straight up. Litton runs across from mid-on and takes a simple catch

<strong>UP AND OVER!</strong> Hasaranga has had enough. Tossed up on leg stump, he backs away, gives himself room and hammers him over mid-on and eventually over the ropes
