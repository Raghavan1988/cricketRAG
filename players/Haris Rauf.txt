Over-pitched yorker, met with the full face of the bat down the ground... and Archer does brilliantly to save, running to his left from a wide long on put in a tumbling effort that saves two

length ball, lumped hard into the covers, making room on the back foot. Jordan swoops at mid-off to cut off the runs, but the 150 is up
Lovely evening's work from Wood. Serious pace, good control, and a brace of wickets. His first outing of the season is a good one

wide line, hacked up in the air, <B>deep third can't get there, but his shy can!</B> In comes the throw from Livingstone as they turn back for two. Miles short, and Pakistan's innings ends with a ball to spare
<B>8.21pm</B> A satisfactory evening for England in the field. Excellent spells from Archer and Wood, and wickets all across the board, including two for Rashid, and two for Liam Livingstone. Here he is: "Really enjoyed bowling with Mo and Rash, bowling off and legspin, work with them away from the games and use them in the matches. We bowled really well. The quick boys were quick and the spinners got something out of the surface. Hopefully we chase them down. I love coming back to England because Motty and Jos rate my bowling. I enjoy it and work hard at it. Hope to contribute in all three facets of the game, and go to the World Cup and try to win it." Plenty to ponder for Pakistan meanwhile. It looked solid enough while Babar and Rizwan were accelerating through the powerplay, but their departures in consecutive overs exposed a middle-order that has plenty of questions hanging over it, with days to go until the main event. Alan will be here for the chase shortly.

Short of a length, swerving away outside off, tries to smack it across the line and not sure if he edged it. Well, the ball just kissed the outside edge and the third umpire is taking a look if Conway's fingers were under the ball, checking from different camera angles, there is doubt and looks like ball hit the ground before going in the gloves, Conway didn't like the decision
