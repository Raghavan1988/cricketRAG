Round the wicket, on a length and angling in from outside off, presses it to Mitchell at wide long on, Southee keeps a lid on the score with a tight last over
It would have been worse for Pakistan had Mohammad Rizwan not bailed them out of trouble; his crucial 90 off 63 has guided them to 158/5. Babar Azam perished at 19 after miscuing a pull to Phillips. Matt Henry was exceptional, took two wickets, and conceded 22 runs. Lockie Ferguson was at his usual best, leaked 27 in his spell and shed two wickets. Pakistan's middle-order woes continue as nobody really got going, and the lean patch from the batters down the order is hurting the side. Mohammad Nawaz's three sixes in a row against Adam Milne in the penultimate over gave some impetus to the innings, which was perpetually on a simmer without quite coming to a boil. I'll be back with the second innings shortly
