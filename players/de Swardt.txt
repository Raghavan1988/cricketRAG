de Swardt is OUT! lbw

Ruan de Swardt lbw b Henry 0 (2b 0x4 0x6 4m) SR: 0
<strong>loud, loud appeal for lbw</strong> after de Swardt shoulders arms and the ball just clips the front pad on its way to the keeper! Given out but de Swardt has reviewed it. It was angling in from well outside off, and it's just about clipping the edge of off stump. So it's umpire's call and the decision stays. De Swardt might think that was a very good leave, but that's the way umpire's call functions
