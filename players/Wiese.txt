How has that missed the stumps?! It's a short ball that sits up and, really, Wiese should smash that for six to the leg side. A huge swing misses and somehow his middle stump remains standing. Single taken as Cross misfields

<strong>Wiese bites the dust too!</strong> Googly bowled a little shortish on middle and off. Sticks in the surface, spins into Wiese and comes off slower than he expects. He was shaping to work it away into the mid wicket region but the lack of pace means that he can only chip it towards long on. Hazlewood makes up ground to his right, slides across and completes the catch!
