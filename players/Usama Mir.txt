Usama Mir b Neesham 5 (3b 1x4 0x6 5m) SR: 166.66
<strong>Tremendous riposte! </strong>Rams the yorker in the blockhole and he goes for a full-blooded swing towards the leg side, ball sneaks through and shatters the stumps, off his pads and onto the stumps, gotta go

<strong>Usama Mir joins the party! </strong> Missed the yorker and he skewed it up and over backward point for a four, it's down to 14 off 5! Magnificent shot, lots of muscle behind that
