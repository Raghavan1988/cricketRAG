Tymal Mills c †Pooran b Joseph 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 2m) SR: 0
Length, sharp, Mills swipes but no dice. Was there a noise? Pooran thinks so and urges Powell to <strong>review</strong>... and he's right! The thinnest sliver of an under edge detected and <strong>England are all out for 171!</strong>
<strong>7.50pm</strong> Andre Russell led that second-half fightback with career-best T20i figures of 3 for 19. He was the one who cottoned onto slower balls doing the trick first and spread the word... "The last delivery of my first over I bowled a slower ball and I realised it gripped. Since then, I told most of the seamers, bowl cutters, make it difficult for then, Pace on delivery, that's where they get most of their runs. As batters, we know they are going to use them as well and we need to be ready to put them away." <strong>7.47pm</strong> Mohd Irshad: "Two perfect half of this inning, one for England another for WI." England were 77 for 0 after 6 overs, then 94 for 10 in the next 13.3.
