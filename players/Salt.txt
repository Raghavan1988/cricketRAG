And while in 2009, it was a one-off T20 engagement, this time around the teams are playing a five-match series. West Indies are 2-1 up with two to play, after England kept the series alive by chasing a target of 223 in rambunctious fashion in Grenada on Saturday"}]Right then. Matthew Forde, West Indies' debutant, has the new ball, Phil Salt is on strike. Here we go... <b>3.55pm:</b> Hello again. We're all set to start on time, and it will be England looking to set the tempo on a sweaty one in Trini (you have my sympathies, Cam) "And still no John Turner," gripes Liam. Yes, it's curious that he's not been given a gallop - although I suppose there's still a series to win, WC pointers to learn, etc. Maybe Thursday's finale will be his lucky day Time for Alan to jump into the hotseat, with the start only ten minutes away. <b>3.50pm:</b> Nicky Pooran is speaking to TV now, and says that he expects the pitch to play on the slow side today. Brian Lara Academy has generally been a happy hunting ground for spinners over the years, and both captains have at least eight overs of frontline spin available to them. Cam tells me it is incredibly humid in Tarouba, adding: "At least for this SW London boy." It's tough work for the touring press pack up in the air-conditioned media box... <b>3.45pm:</b> Harry Brook has been chatting to TNT Sports, mainly about his match-winning innings the other night. He was one of the six Englishmen signed at the IPL auction in Dubai earlier today, joining Ricky Ponting's Delhi Capitals for INR 4 crore - around £400,000. That's a major paycut compared to his seven-figure salary at Sunrisers Hyderabad last year... but still useful wedge. For any readers in the US, you can watch tonight's game via ESPN+ by <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/1b3ab2b5-f179-4872-a64b-f33978c57200/country/us/redirected/true#bucketId=23396">clicking here</a>. <b>3.30pm:</b> Time for the toss. Rovman Powell and Jos Buttler - new Rajasthan team-mates - are out there. <b>West Indies win the toss and will bowl first.</b> "I think you know what I'm going to do, Badree," Powell says with a smile. "It looks a pretty good surface. Joseph misses out, in comes Matthew Forde for his first T20 game for the West Indies. He's brimming with confidence." Some confusion over whether it's Kyle Mayers or Johnson Charles opening alongside Brandon King, thanks to conflicting graphics on different TV feeds... but West Indies' social media accounts suggest the answer is Mayers. Jos Buttler says he would have chosen to bowl. "Looks a decent surface, but we'd have liked to chase as well. Execution is always the key. They've got a lot of power... It's been great information-gathering but we also want to win games of cricket. Try and ride the confidence from the last game." <b>Two changes: Woakes and Rehan in, Mills and Atkinson out.</b> And Salt will keep! Top work from Cam. <b>West Indies:</b> 1 Brandon King, 2 Kyle Mayers, 3 Shai Hope, 4 Nicholas Pooran (wk), 5 Rovman Powell (capt), 6 Sherfane Rutherford, 7 Andre Russell, 8 Jason Holder, 9 Matthew Forde, 10 Akeal Hosein, 11 Gudakesh Motie <b>England:</b> 1 Jos Buttler (capt), 2 Phil Salt (wk), 3 Will Jacks, 4 Liam Livingstone, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Sam Curran, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Rehan Ahmed, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Reece Topley. <b>3.25pm:</b> Thanks Alan - fingers crossed that it doesn't come to that! Toss coming up shortly, rain permitting. "<b>Believe Salt is keeping wicket</b>," says Cam at the venue. "Doing lots of warm-ups." Although he has had a glance at the teamsheet, which says it's Buttler for the time being... intriguing. Watch this space. And for the toss, I'll hand you over to Matt Roller - who's ready to regale you with all the tales from the IPL auction should it start to rain properly in Tarouba. <b>3.15pm:</b> Good news! "The covers are coming off," says Cam. Hopefully the weather will play ball, so the teams can, too. While we build up to the toss, which I think is still scheduled for 3.30pm, here is Cameron's piece from the other day on Harry Brook (who might have caught the eye of an IPL franchise today) and Phil Salt (who sadly did not) and <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/phil-salt-and-harry-brook-announce-themselves-as-england-s-next-gen-1413325>the arrival of England's next gen</a> in that aforementioned Grenada game <b>3.10pm:</b> "In news you'll be delighted to hear," Cameron adds, "the covers are on." We are certainly not delighted to hear that, Cam. But he says that the players are still warming up, so fingers crossed it is just overzealous groundskeeping. In news from the home camp, there are a couple of changes to the squad for these last two games: <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shimron-hetmyer-dropped-alzarri-joseph-rested-for-last-two-t20is-against-england-1413426>Shimron Hetmyer has been dropped, while Alzarri Joseph is rested</a>, with Johnson Charles and Oshane Thomas taking their places <b>3pm:</b> What's that, you want to talk about the IPL auction? <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2024-auction-mitchell-starc-travis-head-rachin-ravindra-shardul-thakur-go-under-the-hammer-1413456>Well, there's a time and a place</a>, and I'm sure we'll get there at some point. For now, Cameron Ponsonby has been in touch with this intel from the ground: "Mills, Atkinson and Turner have been doing the naughty boy early bowl. But Topley is here as well so unless they've decided to play absolutely no one dunno what's going on." He then follows up with something more decisive: "Atkinson, Mills out; Woakes, Rehan in." We'll find out if he's right at the toss shortly <b>2.50pm:</b> Good afternoon all, welcome to round four of England's T20 tonkathon in the Caribbean. Tonight's contest will take place in Trinidad's Brian Lara Stadium, a venue commissioned for the 2007 World Cup... which finally hosted its first senior men's international last year. It will mark England's return to T&T for the first time since playing a Test and T20I in Trini in 2009, at the island's more famous venue: Queen's Park Oval. (Fun fact: Amjad Khan made <i>both</i> of his England debuts at the ground.) Since that tour, England have been back to the Caribbean on six separate trips and not made it to these parts.

"Been a great series, entertaining, great that it's 2-2 going into the last one," says Jos Buttler. "Got to earn the right, but playing with confidence. T20 takes one or two guys on either side." Same team is confirmed. <B>England</B> 1 Phil Salt (wk), 2 Jos Buttler (capt), 3 Will Jacks, 4 Liam Livingstone, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Sam Curran, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Rehan Ahmed, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Reece Topley. <B>West Indies</B> 1 Brandon King, 2 Johnson Charles, 3 Nicholas Pooran (wk), 4 Shai Hope, 5 Sherfane Rutherford, 6 Rovman Powell (capt), 7 Andre Russell, 8 Jason Holder, 9 Akeal Hosein, 10 Oshane Thomas, 11 Gudakesh Motie. <B>3.33pm</B> The toss is coming up... brace for impact. <B>3.15pm</B> It seems that England will be going in with an unchanged team... all will be confirmed shortly! Talking of World Cup prep, Matt Roller spoke to Jason Holder about his determination to win the trophy on home soil for West Indies, having opted to sit out of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/jason-holder-test-career-is-by-no-means-over-after-australia-tour-opt-out-1413758">forthcoming Test tour of Australia.</a> <B>3.12pm</B> After a moribund start to this tour, with four losses in five games, England have really hit their straps in the past week. And it's all been very timely for Matthew Mott, England's beleaguered head coach, who is <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/matthew-mott-england-close-to-t20-world-cup-squad-after-bounce-back-1413760">feeling a lot better</a> about his squad permutations for the World Cup next year. <B>2.52pm</B> Good afternoon, welcome to the ultimate festive showdown. It's two games apiece in a T20I bosh-fest, with upwards of 100 sixes having been launched into the Caribbean and plenty more to come, to judge by <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-tour-of-west-indies-2023-24-1373558/west-indies-vs-england-4th-t20i-1373582/full-scorecard">Tuesday's record-breaking exploits.</a> The toss for this series decider is coming up in about half an hour's time. Stay tuned! Cameron Ponsonby is lurking on the boundary's edge, and reckons Phil Salt, England's twin-centurion man of the moment, will be keeping wicket once again. "Mills, Turner, Topley doing the early bowl-throughs," he adds. Make of that what you will!

They would have needed 109 from ten overs to beat Scotland in Barbados. Will they need more than that in 11 to beat Namibia in Antigua? Here's the innings we never got to see that day. <B>David Wiese</B> will take the new ball. Remember one bowler can bowl three. The rest have a maximum of two. Here's the countdown. Play! <strong>3:51pm</strong>: Time for the national anthems. The big flags are out, players follow. England to go first. Chris: "What kind of total do you think England should aim for? 120?" Yeah, 110 at least. Miller will be on soon to maybe give his opinion and then kick things off. Dave: "I've upped my schadenfreude to level two. England manage to sneak in a win off the last available ball only to watch the Scotland game abandoned due to rain." Nick: "Although teams can't declare, couldn't they just retire all the remaining batters out anyway? For the record, it's 5:53am here in Aus and I've been staying up all night!" Michael Atherton says that the pitch is still looking good and the weather has been a puzzle, and hopes the rain doesn't return. <strong>England XI</strong>: 1 Phil Salt, 2 Jos Buttler, 3 Jonny Bairstow, 4 Harry Brook, 5 Moeen Ali, 6 Liam Livingstone, 7 Sam Curran, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Reece Topley <strong>Namibia XI</strong>: 1 Nikolaas Davin, 2 Michael van Lingen, 3 Jan Frylinck, 4 JP Kotze, 5 Gerhard Erasmus (capt), 6 JJ Smit, 7 David Wiese, 8 Zane Green, 9 Ruben Trumpelmann, 10 Bernard Scholtz, 11 Jack Brassell <strong>Jos Buttler, England captain</strong>: (Phew?) Yeah (<em>laughs</em>). Frustrating but glad we're getting a game. We would have bowled. <strong>Two changes: Wood and Jacks out, Curran and Jordan in</strong> We need to adapt to the conditions and 11 overs. Every team is dangerous, especially in a short game. Fully focused on the challenge in hand and give our best shot. <strong>Gerhard Erasmus, Namibia captain</strong>: Easy call in the shortened game. One change: Coetzee comes in for Shikongo. We wanted a better foundation with the bat, even in a shortened game that is the best way to go. We want to compete at the highest level, against one of the best teams in the world. That's our goal. <strong>3:39pm</strong>: Toss time, one correction, <strong>only one bowler can bowl three overs</strong>. Namibia win the toss and bowl first <strong>3:19pm</strong>: You might need to lift your jaws off the floor cos <strong>4pm has been announced as the start time for a 11-overs-per-side game. Toss at 3:40pm local.</strong> There will be three overs of powerplay. Three bowlers can bowl a maximum of three overs. Martin: "Can England bat, score a quick 70, then declare?Then, 5  overs for Namibia equals a game.Can you declare in T20?" They can't. Playing conditions say DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE Shall not apply. Ram: "I want Namibia to win the toss, choose to bowl first and then see England score 150 in their 11 overs. After which Namibia stumble and collapse to 25-9 in 4.5 overs and then rain to stop the game fully, then and there." What was that thing about schadenfreude again? Avnish: "@Ekanth - Amidst all that breaking news, you missed the most critical aspect..P.S : subject to no further showers!!" Lol yeah, it is implied and let's just forget about it for now. Despite the clouds being just as thick. Jez: "Positive news! But given the weather, why on earth don't they just play a 5-over game, in case there is only time for 10 overs? As happened in the Eng-Scot game!" I'm torn on this but taking the best possible outcome, despite it being unlikely, is an appreciable gamble. Moody: "Somebody wake up that guy from Singapore!!!" <strong>3:15pm</strong>: Okay, let's do this dance again. There have been improvements, some of the covers on the pitch have come off, first time in a while. The umpires have been checking things out for five minutes. They've even had a small word with Buttler and, later, Rashid. <strong>3pm</strong>: Update is in, and it's predictably grim. Ian Ward says we are losing overs already. <strong>4:46pm local is the latest point at which a five-over game can begin.</strong> But it's still raining, and every time it has stopped and the staff come on to clear things up, it restarts. At least it's not stopping the cricket fans are playing in the concourse. Next update slotted at 4pm. PraChand: "If 5 over Match happens, what are the chances Scotland will win ?" They'd remain zero, because they aren't playing. prad: "goodnight from Singapore I'm all but convinced there's gonna be no match. " GG, prad. Kudos for chugging on till... wow, 3:10am spinner : "while I'm not disappointed for England, well maybe a little. I'm happy for Scotland if it keeps raining" <strong>2:45pm</strong>: The umpires and reserve umpire are having a word with a couple of groundstaff members. No umbrellas above. Of course, they go up right after I type. There is a slight drizzle but Bairstow and Jordan are out. Topley too. Well, that's changing, rain's getting heavier. Prabhav: "Whenever you type the rain comes back..." Wish that wasn't true. Same for things changing right after being typed out. <strong>2:30pm</strong> There is a puddle on the cover, rest of it's wet too. So, not great signs. The skies have gotten darker and there's no one on the ground half an hour ahead of the next scheduled update. Aneel: "Next 30mins are crucial " Yeah, a few minutes in, a handful of members from the groundstaff are on the outfield.

Aditya: "Hi, just tuning in. does a washout mean England are eliminated irrespective of the Australia Scotland game?" It would mean exactly that.

"The next update" will be at 2pm local time, according to the ICC. That's not an inspection as such, but it might count as progress. Aditya: "Hi, just tuning in. does a washout mean England are eliminated irrespective of the Australia Scotland game?" It would mean exactly that. I believe the latest start time for a five-over contest would be<strong> approximately 4.45pm local time.</strong> So that is the ultimate cut-off of cut-offs. <B>12.56pm</B> There's a bit of movement on the covers at the moment. Just a bit of assessment from the groundstaff, as they work out how much standing water needs to be removed. The umpires are poking around with their umbrellas. The wait goes on. allie: "I was under the impression we start losing overs 90 minutes AFTER scheduled start of play which I thought was 13hrs ground time" Yes, I think you are right. Reset that clock! Sammo: "If the rain continues, is it even worth trying to analyse Eng's performance at this tournament? I feel we've learned so little" It's true. You'd have thought that Matthew Mott's position would be untenable in the event of an early elimination, but two washouts would mitigate that significantly. <B>12.50pm</B> The umpires are wandering out to take a look, which is encouraging - not so much that a start time is imminent, but that the rain has eased enough to make it worthwhile! brandon: "why have a cut off in 70 mins?! - surely thay can play until 10pm under lights." Well quite. If this was Wimbledon, you'd make up time in the schedule to play the backed-up games! To clarify, that cut-off refers to the limit for a full game. Any start after that will involve a reduction in overs. Ravi: "Feeling sad for Namibia. Three extra games for Scotland comes at the expense of one game of Namibia" Yes, this is a huge day for them too, first T20I against England and all that. Suffice to say, both teams will want to get out there and play! NRT: "England is better company to New Zealand and Pakistan. let's hope this match is abandoned so that they can plan a quick T20 Tri-Series between them " Stranger things have happened in this over-congested sport! <B>12.43pm</B> Yikes, that interview is cut short by an <em>absolute downpour!</em> It's barely possible to hear Hussain, Ward and Morgan on the host broadcast, as they don their brollies and try to keep talking shop. This is going to eat significantly into that cut-off time... <B>12.41pm</B> Phil Salt is talking to the host broadcaster. "You've got to be smart in your analysis of the opposition, there can't be any surprises on game day. There's no one thing that's [contributed to his form]. Jos and I know each other's games inside out. Keep it simple and communicate." <B>12.32pm</B> The groundstaff in Antigua are apparently optimistic. The rain has been of a showery variety, rather than the endless deluges that wrecked the Scotland contest in Barbados. Either way, the countdown clock begins... 88 minutes until we start to lose overs. And the shorter this contest, the better the prospects for Namibia to score an upset. Amol: "Only if ICC had transferred the games from Florida to Dallas. Everyone knew the bleak forecast atleast 2 days before" Yes, there is a lack of flexibility in such schedules, which might become something to consider if damp northern-hemisphere summers become the norm. When Lauderdale Airport was flooded on the eve of that leg, you did wonder if it was wise to persevere! Simon: "If England win the toss I'd rather see them bat first and go out blasting just in case of rain later. DLS always seems to work against the team chasing (hence why so many think Scotland would have won that 10 over match)" <B>12.30pm</B> Right, which way is this one headed? It's toss time in Antigua. <strong>Or not, as the covers are back on... </strong> <B>12.21pm</B> We're about ten minutes away from the toss. Stay tuned! Saifi: "If there's any rain predicted for next three hours, England must go to choose bowl first. That's the only way they can win it within the two hour duration " Indeed, that was a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/england-vs-oman-28th-match-group-b-1415728/full-scorecard">very successful formula in their last outing</a>. Anything that speeds the contest along is probably in their interests. Mark: "England have previous against Namibia. A laboured victory in a 50-over WC game that led to elimination, I believe. Problems with Burgers who seemed super-sized that day. Can't see it happening again..." Indeed. The puns wrote themselves in that tournament. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/flashes-in-the-world-cup-pan-284351>Halcyon days!</A> <B>12.13pm</B> Anyhow, the signs from Antigua are that a washout won't be the upshot. The shots from the ground show a sufficiency of blue sky on the horizon, even if one or two showers may yet roll across. Shadow-Shell: "@Vipin I don't know,  I feel like rain adds it's own natural flavor to the games" It certainly helps the grass grow. And yes, I've enjoyed the dominance of the bowlers at venues such as New York, even if it hasn't been the big-hitting spectacle we were promised! Desmo: "Anyone else, possibly including a certain Australian bowler named "Josh", doing a rain dance at the moment?" Absolutely not, this is a no-Schadenfreude zone, remember! <B>12.07pm</B> Bharat: "I know you won't publish it. I dare you to publish..Schadenfreude Miller? Really? Is there a worser way to show your fanatic patriotism to England? Why can't someone support Scotland to qualify just for the mere aspect that it makes the World Cup really the "World" cup? It's boring to watch same teams in the more serious rounds.. cometh a day when some associate team qualify beating India, I will still be happy for that team." Dare accepted. Over-reaction detected! Sure there are plenty of people rooting for Scotland either way, especially when they take the field against Australia this evening/tomorrow. But you can't pretend there wouldn't be one or two laughing at England in the event of a washout here... and I suspect you, Bharat, would be nailed firmly in that camp! <B>11.55am</B> The covers are coming off, which will be a significant relief to England. Jim: "@Miller. AUS-SCO is not "at the same venue tomorrow". It's today, Saturday. " I can't keep up with the ludicrous time-zones for this tournament. Suffice to say, it's tomorrow where I am, but today where I'm not! Joshua: "It's also not the same venue. Scotland/Australia is in St. Lucia. Sorry!" That's it, I quit... vipin gulati: "ICC should look into climate before giving the rights to host World Cup.  It takes all the fun away from these washed out matches " I fear you'd need to play on the moon to avoid the impact of climate change these days. And even if you did that, the atmosphere would be non-existent. Gettit? <strong>11.42am</strong> The early news from the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium is not promising (unless you're a fan of either Scotland or Schadenfreude...) But, there's still more than an hour until the start, and there's 90 minutes of spare time to factor in before we start losing overs. Maya: "Can't wait for this clash! It sounds a bit like a playoff - assuming that Aus beat Scotland - because a win will most likely take England to the super 8s! The India Canada game has just been washed out, sadly. Hope it doesn't play a spoilsport here!" Indeed,<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/canada-vs-india-33rd-match-group-a-1415733/live-cricket-score"> here's what didn't take place</a> in Lauderhill earlier today... <strong>11.30am</strong> Good morning all, welcome to the day of pre-reckoning. England's T20 World Cup progression hangs in the balance after their slow start to the campaign, and while there'll be no guarantees of a place in the Super Eight this afternoon - that will only be decided once Scotland have faced Australia <S>at this same venue tomorrow </s> somewhere, some time - anything less than victory will confirm they are toast. And so, welcome to the Thunderdome, Namibia, for the first meeting of these two teams in T20I history, and only their second in official international history, after their clash at <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-cup-2002-03-61124/england-vs-namibia-19th-match-65252/full-scorecard">the 2003 World Cup in South Africa</a>. For Jan-Berrie Burger and Rudi van Vuuren, read David Wiese and Ruben Trumpelmann. There's plenty quality in this Namibia line-up, but can they rattle a side that won at an obscene gallop in their last outing, against Oman two days ago? We will find out soon enough! The toss is coming up in just under an hour's time.
