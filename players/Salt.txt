<b>chipped to mid-off, Forde has a wicket on debut!</b> Looks like Joseph got his hands under the ball, and West Indies celebrate - although Salt is unmoved and will wait for the TV umpire to check this. There's only one really good angle but it definitely looks like fingers are clutching the ball as he stoops to take it, and up goes the finger again!

There's a minute's silence in memory of Joe Solomon and Clyde Butts, whose deaths have been announced in the last 24 hours - and then we're good to go. Matthew Forde has the new ball on debut, two slips in place <b>3.28pm:</b> The action from Kensington Oval is coming up in short order... but while we have been waiting, West Indies have announced their squad for the T20Is against England, <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/andre-russell-recalled-to-west-indies-t20i-squad-after-two-year-absence-1412098>with the headline being a recall for Andre Russell</a>, more than two years after his previous outing in maroon <b>3.20pm:</b> Well then. Might there be a bit of juice in the deck, with the covers having been on and plenty of moisture around over the last 24 hours? Six of the last ten ODIs here have seen the team batting first bowled out for less than 200, so it could be a testing period for England's all-guns-blazing top order to attempt to weather... <b>3.10pm:</b> Skies look clear in Bridgetown. Toss coming up imminently... <b>West Indies win and bowl</b>, Shai Hope wants to chase in this shortened game with the possibility of more rain around. West Indies have brought in 21-year-old allrounder Matthew Forde for a debut, in place of Oshane Thomas. "We have to start a lot better with bat and ball, get some momentum," Hope says. As flagged earlier, Potts replaces Carse in the England XI - that's because Carse is feeling unwell. "Looks a really good wicket," Jos Buttler says, "we would have looked to bowl, for obvious reasons, but it should be a good pitch." <b>West Indies:</b> 1 Alick Athanaze, 2 Brandon King, 3 Keacy Carty, 4 Shai Hope (capt & wk), 5 Shimron Hetmyer, 6 Sherfane Rutherford, 7 Romario Shepherd, 8 Yannic Cariah, 9 Alzarri Joseph, 10 Gudakesh Motie, 11 Matthew Forde <b>England:</b> 1 Will Jacks, 2 Phil Salt, 3 Zak Crawley, 4 Ben Duckett, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Jos Buttler (capt & wk), 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Sam Curran, 9 Rehan Ahmed, 10 Gus Atkinson, 11 Matt Potts <b>2.58pm:</b> We have news of cricket! <b>Toss at 3.10pm for a 3.30pm start</b>, with the game reduced to 43 overs per side. Three bowlers can deliver nine overs, two eight. The first powerplay will be nine overs, the last eight. Don't go anywhere now "OK, let's talk about the WPL. Can anyone explain the non-selection of Athapaththu?" The short answer is no, Declan. The long one is being worked on by NASA scientists as I type <b>2.52pm:</b> More #GoodVibesOnly from Cam: Teams coming out to warm up again." <b>2.47pm:</b> Hold the phone: "Covers are coming off," reports Cam. "Blue skies to the right [which direction is this? - Orienteering Ed], might get some cricket." See, I told you there was nothing to worry about with the weather <b>2.45pm:</b> Still no positive news to bring from Kensington Oval.

Here's the latest from Cam Ponsonby: "Yeah we ain't getting on for a while. Big clouds over to the right and even if it stops will need drying time now." <B>2pm</b> Right, there is a spectacular amount of milling about going on out there. A few umbrellas, a lot of desultory cover-fiddling and a bit of outfield football. Pass the gin! Here's Alan to keep you occupied for the foreseeable. Damien: "Rain stopped and bright sunshine in northern Barbados. Was getting ready to leave for the Oval when I saw you mention rain was back, lol indeed" Et voila! Here you go, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ollie-pope-ready-deputise-ben-stokes-india-tour-1412088">get your peepers around this </a>while we wait for further updates... Rob: "Potts swings the ball. Hes the obvious choice to play given the conditions." Roy: "Ponsonby is doing his best, leave him alone." Indeed, he is a massive tryhard. In fact, he'll have some red-hot-off-the-press Ollie Pope quotes to keep you entertained shortly... <B>1.43pm</B> The covers are going back on. Lol. "I'm not sure it's even raining," says Ponsonby. There are certainly blue skies overhead still... "I am now sure it is raining," he adds. This is the breaking news that earns him the big bucks. Anubhab Mukherj: "I agree Andrew that he will get a game. However, let's not forget that Turner was an original pick for the series, and Potts was only a replacement. Potts getting a game ahead of Turner feels wrong. Not to mention that we need to develop genuine pacers for SA in 2027." <B>1.36pm</B> We will have the toss in 15 minutes! <strong>Toss at 1.50pm, start at 2.10pm</strong>. Here we go. <B>1.33pm</B> Right, the covers are officially off. But there's still clouds building up in the east. We should get some play imminently it seems, but there might be more delays to come. Sit tight... the outfield is still a bit damp, so that might have an impact on the spinners, according to Samuel Badree, who is pitchside for the TNT Sports coverage. <B>1.21pm</B> Covers coming off! Arthur Christmas can go hang. We have action... Anubhab Mukherj: "I hear so much about John Turner's pace, and the guy doesn't get a game. This is not how the restart should be." He'll get his chance I'm sure. Only so many can play in any one match, to be fair. <B>1.18pm</B> Twiddle, twiddle ... no news is no news. Gotta love some festive Saturday night viewing! Might end up with a ball-by-ball of Arthur Christmas at this rate... ShahSafeer: "Jos Buttler really needs to start opening the innings for England, that's where he could show is real ability with the bat. He's someone who's capable of scoring 150s or even 200s in this format. Salt should bat at three or ideally at five! " <B>1.01pm</B> Well, it ought to be toss time, but the covers are resolutely in place. We wait... We had a downpour for about 10-15 minutes earlier, but there's signs of blue skies in the distance. Still drizzling for now though. Meh. The weather tends to improve from 3pm, so we might have two hours of thumb-twiddling to come. Damien: "Greetings again from Barbados. The forecast of heavy rain proving very much true. Haven't even left home yet because of heavy showers in the north. Will be a busy evening for the groundsmen I fear." Sarem: "Not to mention your own weathermanship during those two horrid days at Old Trafford..." Well, yes, my Twitter feed was compelling viewing, I grant you... <B>12.35pm</B> "Covers on," laments Ponsonby. Boo. "Don't know how much covers on and off stuff you want over the next hour..." he adds, clearly oblivious of Andrew Fidel Fernando's unmissable turn as ESPNcricinfo's weatherman during the Asia Cup. I can't get enough of such updates, personally... While we wait for any clear guidance on this evening's prospects, one England team has already wrapped up their three-match series today. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-women-in-india-2023-24-1406061/india-women-vs-england-women-2nd-t20i-1406074/live-cricket-score">Can the women's success </a>rub off on the men this evening? <B>12.31pm</B> Matt Potts has marked out his run-up, according to the beady-eyed Ponsonby. Intriguing scenes. <B>Potts for Carse</B> appears to be the only change. In other news, Woakes, Mills, Rashid and Moeen have all linked up with the squad, ahead of the T20Is next week. Don't forget, if you're in the USA, you can follow today's action on ESPN+. <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/67d9693f-a83c-490e-84d0-99b0407d2465/country/us/redirected/true#bucketId=23396">Click here </a>for all the linky goodness you could need. Raff: "Sufficiency of Action would be a good name for Paul Adams' autobiography.  Frog in a blender isn't a pretty action, but it worked." <B>12.21pm</B> There's been some sad news coming out of the Caribbean in recent days, with the deaths of both Joe Solomon and Clyde Butts, both of whom played with distinction for West Indies and Guyana. They will be remembered with a moment of silence before the start of play today, and West Indies will wear black armbands as well. Solomon, who was 93, is perhaps best remembered for his iconic run-out at Brisbane in 1960-61, which secured the original Tied Test. <a href="https://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1073513/the-man-in-the-photo">Here is an interview</a> we ran with him back in 2017. As for Butts, he played only a handful of Tests in the 1980s, when, as an offspinner, his skills were somewhat redundant given the pace power at West Indies' disposal. But as an administrator, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/former-west-indies-offspinner-and-selection-chief-clyde-butts-dies-at-66-1412060">he was hugely significant</a>, most notably as Chairman of Selectors when West Indies won the T20 World Cup in 2012. Rest in peace, both. <B>12.17pm</B> Afternoon all, welcome to Bridgetown for the series decider. It's West Indies versus England in the third and final ODI, and the end of the road for a dispiriting 2023 in the 50-over format for both teams. Who gets to go out on a high... ahead of five T20Is before Christmas of course... Cameron Ponsonby is our man in Barbados, and he's not got the best of news to greet us, unfortunately. "Incredibly light dirzzle. Dark clouds everywhere but covers coming off," he says. There is definitely the prospect of interruptions tonight. Fingers crossed we get a sufficiency of action.

Here come the teams, Rovman Powell directing traffic for West Indies as Phil Salt and Jos Buttler head for the middle. Akeal Hosein is going to open the bowling, he has a slip in <b>5.50pm:</b> So it will be England's slightly new-look batting order - a sort of hybrid of the squad that went to Pakistan last year and the one that won the T20 World Cup - to try and set a target at Kensington Oval. They are using the same pitch as for the ODI, so every chance it will be a bit up-and-down, a bit grippy. Can they get a score on the board to test what looks a powerful West Indies line-up? One other thing to look out for today is <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sixty-second-stop-clock-trial-begins-with-t20i-series-between-west-indies-and-england-1412253>the first use of a stop clock</a> between overs, part of a bid by the ICC to speed up play "Hoping Jacks takes his chance and becomes a first choice ahead of Ali and Livingstone." He's doubtless thinking the same thing, Neal, having narrowly missed out on two World Cups, and a central contract, in the last year and a bit <b>5.35pm: West Indies win the toss and bowl</b>, Rovman Powell says: "Looks a pretty good surface, we'll see how well our bowlers can restrict these English batters." Andre Russell is confirmed in the XI, making his West Indies comeback after more than two years out of the side. Six of the players involved - Powell, Russell, Jason Holder, Nicholas Pooran, Kyle Mayers and Akeal Hosein - come straight in from the Abu Dhabi T10.

Here come the teams, Rovman Powell directing traffic for West Indies as Phil Salt and Jos Buttler head for the middle. Akeal Hosein is going to open the bowling, he has a slip in <b>5.50pm:</b> So it will be England's slightly new-look batting order - a sort of hybrid of the squad that went to Pakistan last year and the one that won the T20 World Cup - to try and set a target at Kensington Oval. They are using the same pitch as for the ODI, so every chance it will be a bit up-and-down, a bit grippy. Can they get a score on the board to test what looks a powerful West Indies line-up? One other thing to look out for today is <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sixty-second-stop-clock-trial-begins-with-t20i-series-between-west-indies-and-england-1412253>the first use of a stop clock</a> between overs, part of a bid by the ICC to speed up play "Hoping Jacks takes his chance and becomes a first choice ahead of Ali and Livingstone." He's doubtless thinking the same thing, Neal, having narrowly missed out on two World Cups, and a central contract, in the last year and a bit <b>5.35pm: West Indies win the toss and bowl</b>, Rovman Powell says: "Looks a pretty good surface, we'll see how well our bowlers can restrict these English batters." Andre Russell is confirmed in the XI, making his West Indies comeback after more than two years out of the side. Six of the players involved - Powell, Russell, Jason Holder, Nicholas Pooran, Kyle Mayers and Akeal Hosein - come straight in from the Abu Dhabi T10. Jos Buttler says he would have looked to chase, too. "Excited to be playing T20 again, lots to look forward to," he says. "We need to find out a few things [ahead of the World Cup]."

Right then. Matthew Forde, West Indies' debutant, has the new ball, Phil Salt is on strike. Here we go... <b>3.55pm:</b> Hello again. We're all set to start on time, and it will be England looking to set the tempo on a sweaty one in Trini (you have my sympathies, Cam) "And still no John Turner," gripes Liam. Yes, it's curious that he's not been given a gallop - although I suppose there's still a series to win, WC pointers to learn, etc. Maybe Thursday's finale will be his lucky day Time for Alan to jump into the hotseat, with the start only ten minutes away. <b>3.50pm:</b> Nicky Pooran is speaking to TV now, and says that he expects the pitch to play on the slow side today. Brian Lara Academy has generally been a happy hunting ground for spinners over the years, and both captains have at least eight overs of frontline spin available to them. Cam tells me it is incredibly humid in Tarouba, adding: "At least for this SW London boy." It's tough work for the touring press pack up in the air-conditioned media box... <b>3.45pm:</b> Harry Brook has been chatting to TNT Sports, mainly about his match-winning innings the other night. He was one of the six Englishmen signed at the IPL auction in Dubai earlier today, joining Ricky Ponting's Delhi Capitals for INR 4 crore - around £400,000. That's a major paycut compared to his seven-figure salary at Sunrisers Hyderabad last year... but still useful wedge. For any readers in the US, you can watch tonight's game via ESPN+ by <a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/player/_/id/1b3ab2b5-f179-4872-a64b-f33978c57200/country/us/redirected/true#bucketId=23396">clicking here</a>. <b>3.30pm:</b> Time for the toss. Rovman Powell and Jos Buttler - new Rajasthan team-mates - are out there. <b>West Indies win the toss and will bowl first.</b> "I think you know what I'm going to do, Badree," Powell says with a smile. "It looks a pretty good surface. Joseph misses out, in comes Matthew Forde for his first T20 game for the West Indies. He's brimming with confidence." Some confusion over whether it's Kyle Mayers or Johnson Charles opening alongside Brandon King, thanks to conflicting graphics on different TV feeds... but West Indies' social media accounts suggest the answer is Mayers. Jos Buttler says he would have chosen to bowl. "Looks a decent surface, but we'd have liked to chase as well. Execution is always the key. They've got a lot of power... It's been great information-gathering but we also want to win games of cricket. Try and ride the confidence from the last game." <b>Two changes: Woakes and Rehan in, Mills and Atkinson out.</b> And Salt will keep! Top work from Cam. <b>West Indies:</b> 1 Brandon King, 2 Kyle Mayers, 3 Shai Hope, 4 Nicholas Pooran (wk), 5 Rovman Powell (capt), 6 Sherfane Rutherford, 7 Andre Russell, 8 Jason Holder, 9 Matthew Forde, 10 Akeal Hosein, 11 Gudakesh Motie <b>England:</b> 1 Jos Buttler (capt), 2 Phil Salt (wk), 3 Will Jacks, 4 Liam Livingstone, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Sam Curran, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Rehan Ahmed, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Reece Topley. <b>3.25pm:</b> Thanks Alan - fingers crossed that it doesn't come to that! Toss coming up shortly, rain permitting. "<b>Believe Salt is keeping wicket</b>," says Cam at the venue. "Doing lots of warm-ups." Although he has had a glance at the teamsheet, which says it's Buttler for the time being... intriguing. Watch this space. And for the toss, I'll hand you over to Matt Roller - who's ready to regale you with all the tales from the IPL auction should it start to rain properly in Tarouba. <b>3.15pm:</b> Good news! "The covers are coming off," says Cam. Hopefully the weather will play ball, so the teams can, too. While we build up to the toss, which I think is still scheduled for 3.30pm, here is Cameron's piece from the other day on Harry Brook (who might have caught the eye of an IPL franchise today) and Phil Salt (who sadly did not) and <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/phil-salt-and-harry-brook-announce-themselves-as-england-s-next-gen-1413325>the arrival of England's next gen</a> in that aforementioned Grenada game <b>3.10pm:</b> "In news you'll be delighted to hear," Cameron adds, "the covers are on." We are certainly not delighted to hear that, Cam. But he says that the players are still warming up, so fingers crossed it is just overzealous groundskeeping. In news from the home camp, there are a couple of changes to the squad for these last two games: <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shimron-hetmyer-dropped-alzarri-joseph-rested-for-last-two-t20is-against-england-1413426>Shimron Hetmyer has been dropped, while Alzarri Joseph is rested</a>, with Johnson Charles and Oshane Thomas taking their places <b>3pm:</b> What's that, you want to talk about the IPL auction? <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2024-auction-mitchell-starc-travis-head-rachin-ravindra-shardul-thakur-go-under-the-hammer-1413456>Well, there's a time and a place</a>, and I'm sure we'll get there at some point. For now, Cameron Ponsonby has been in touch with this intel from the ground: "Mills, Atkinson and Turner have been doing the naughty boy early bowl. But Topley is here as well so unless they've decided to play absolutely no one dunno what's going on." He then follows up with something more decisive: "Atkinson, Mills out; Woakes, Rehan in." We'll find out if he's right at the toss shortly <b>2.50pm:</b> Good afternoon all, welcome to round four of England's T20 tonkathon in the Caribbean. Tonight's contest will take place in Trinidad's Brian Lara Stadium, a venue commissioned for the 2007 World Cup... which finally hosted its first senior men's international last year. It will mark England's return to T&T for the first time since playing a Test and T20I in Trini in 2009, at the island's more famous venue: Queen's Park Oval. (Fun fact: Amjad Khan made <i>both</i> of his England debuts at the ground.) Since that tour, England have been back to the Caribbean on six separate trips and not made it to these parts. And while in 2009, it was a one-off T20 engagement, this time around the teams are playing a five-match series. West Indies are 2-1 up with two to play, after England kept the series alive by chasing a target of 223 in rambunctious fashion in Grenada on Saturday

While we build up to the toss, which I think is still scheduled for 3.30pm, here is Cameron's piece from the other day on Harry Brook (who might have caught the eye of an IPL franchise today) and Phil Salt (who sadly did not) and <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/phil-salt-and-harry-brook-announce-themselves-as-england-s-next-gen-1413325>the arrival of England's next gen</a> in that aforementioned Grenada game <b>3.10pm:</b> "In news you'll be delighted to hear," Cameron adds, "the covers are on." We are certainly not delighted to hear that, Cam. But he says that the players are still warming up, so fingers crossed it is just overzealous groundskeeping. In news from the home camp, there are a couple of changes to the squad for these last two games: <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shimron-hetmyer-dropped-alzarri-joseph-rested-for-last-two-t20is-against-england-1413426>Shimron Hetmyer has been dropped, while Alzarri Joseph is rested</a>, with Johnson Charles and Oshane Thomas taking their places <b>3pm:</b> What's that, you want to talk about the IPL auction? <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2024-auction-mitchell-starc-travis-head-rachin-ravindra-shardul-thakur-go-under-the-hammer-1413456>Well, there's a time and a place</a>, and I'm sure we'll get there at some point. For now, Cameron Ponsonby has been in touch with this intel from the ground: "Mills, Atkinson and Turner have been doing the naughty boy early bowl. But Topley is here as well so unless they've decided to play absolutely no one dunno what's going on." He then follows up with something more decisive: "Atkinson, Mills out; Woakes, Rehan in." We'll find out if he's right at the toss shortly <b>2.50pm:</b> Good afternoon all, welcome to round four of England's T20 tonkathon in the Caribbean. Tonight's contest will take place in Trinidad's Brian Lara Stadium, a venue commissioned for the 2007 World Cup... which finally hosted its first senior men's international last year. It will mark England's return to T&T for the first time since playing a Test and T20I in Trini in 2009, at the island's more famous venue: Queen's Park Oval. (Fun fact: Amjad Khan made <i>both</i> of his England debuts at the ground.) Since that tour, England have been back to the Caribbean on six separate trips and not made it to these parts. And while in 2009, it was a one-off T20 engagement, this time around the teams are playing a five-match series. West Indies are 2-1 up with two to play, after England kept the series alive by chasing a target of 223 in rambunctious fashion in Grenada on Saturday

Here's Vish to take you through the first ten overs. <B>2.10pm</B> Jofra Archer is back. He's been talking to Sky Sports: "I want to get out there before I can tell how I feel, but been rehabbing for as long as I can remember, so good to be back. The constant robotic routine ... you've got to get up and keep going, but I'm back here so it has to be worth it. Hopefully it stays [dry] and we get a game in. I have been bowling since November last year properly, but there's an extra 10% of intensity for big games. Hopefully I can get through it and get on the plane. I have to take it game by game, can't look too far ahead, but I've never played at Kensington [Oval in Barbados] so fingers crossed." <B>2pm</B> Confusion at the toss but Pakistan win and bowl. "The pitch looks good, a bit of swing." Haris Rauf is back which is a boost. "We have a good bunch of fast bowlers. Simple message to enjoy yourself and prepare for the World Cup. T20 is a fast game, need to play according to the situation." England would have looked to chase, too, says Jos Buttler. "Excited for Jofra, long road for him but looks great and looks fit. Livingstone, excited for him too, lots of options within the team. We are focussed on the here and now, fantastic to be back in England, looking forward to today."

Will they need more than that in 11 to beat Namibia in Antigua? Here's the innings we never got to see that day. <B>David Wiese</B> will take the new ball. Remember one bowler can bowl three. The rest have a maximum of two. Here's the countdown. Play! <strong>3:51pm</strong>: Time for the national anthems. The big flags are out, players follow. England to go first. Chris: "What kind of total do you think England should aim for? 120?" Yeah, 110 at least. Miller will be on soon to maybe give his opinion and then kick things off. Dave: "I've upped my schadenfreude to level two. England manage to sneak in a win off the last available ball only to watch the Scotland game abandoned due to rain." Nick: "Although teams can't declare, couldn't they just retire all the remaining batters out anyway? For the record, it's 5:53am here in Aus and I've been staying up all night!" Michael Atherton says that the pitch is still looking good and the weather has been a puzzle, and hopes the rain doesn't return. <strong>England XI</strong>: 1 Phil Salt, 2 Jos Buttler, 3 Jonny Bairstow, 4 Harry Brook, 5 Moeen Ali, 6 Liam Livingstone, 7 Sam Curran, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Reece Topley <strong>Namibia XI</strong>: 1 Nikolaas Davin, 2 Michael van Lingen, 3 Jan Frylinck, 4 JP Kotze, 5 Gerhard Erasmus (capt), 6 JJ Smit, 7 David Wiese, 8 Zane Green, 9 Ruben Trumpelmann, 10 Bernard Scholtz, 11 Jack Brassell <strong>Jos Buttler, England captain</strong>: (Phew?) Yeah (<em>laughs</em>). Frustrating but glad we're getting a game. We would have bowled. <strong>Two changes: Wood and Jacks out, Curran and Jordan in</strong> We need to adapt to the conditions and 11 overs. Every team is dangerous, especially in a short game. Fully focused on the challenge in hand and give our best shot. <strong>Gerhard Erasmus, Namibia captain</strong>: Easy call in the shortened game. One change: Coetzee comes in for Shikongo. We wanted a better foundation with the bat, even in a shortened game that is the best way to go. We want to compete at the highest level, against one of the best teams in the world. That's our goal. <strong>3:39pm</strong>: Toss time, one correction, <strong>only one bowler can bowl three overs</strong>. Namibia win the toss and bowl first <strong>3:19pm</strong>: You might need to lift your jaws off the floor cos <strong>4pm has been announced as the start time for a 11-overs-per-side game. Toss at 3:40pm local.</strong> There will be three overs of powerplay. Three bowlers can bowl a maximum of three overs. Martin: "Can England bat, score a quick 70, then declare?Then, 5  overs for Namibia equals a game.Can you declare in T20?" They can't. Playing conditions say DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE Shall not apply. Ram: "I want Namibia to win the toss, choose to bowl first and then see England score 150 in their 11 overs. After which Namibia stumble and collapse to 25-9 in 4.5 overs and then rain to stop the game fully, then and there." What was that thing about schadenfreude again? Avnish: "@Ekanth - Amidst all that breaking news, you missed the most critical aspect..P.S : subject to no further showers!!" Lol yeah, it is implied and let's just forget about it for now. Despite the clouds being just as thick. Jez: "Positive news! But given the weather, why on earth don't they just play a 5-over game, in case there is only time for 10 overs? As happened in the Eng-Scot game!" I'm torn on this but taking the best possible outcome, despite it being unlikely, is an appreciable gamble. Moody: "Somebody wake up that guy from Singapore!!!" <strong>3:15pm</strong>: Okay, let's do this dance again. There have been improvements, some of the covers on the pitch have come off, first time in a while. The umpires have been checking things out for five minutes. They've even had a small word with Buttler and, later, Rashid. <strong>3pm</strong>: Update is in, and it's predictably grim. Ian Ward says we are losing overs already. <strong>4:46pm local is the latest point at which a five-over game can begin.</strong> But it's still raining, and every time it has stopped and the staff come on to clear things up, it restarts. At least it's not stopping the cricket fans are playing in the concourse. Next update slotted at 4pm. PraChand: "If 5 over Match happens, what are the chances Scotland will win ?" They'd remain zero, because they aren't playing. prad: "goodnight from Singapore I'm all but convinced there's gonna be no match. " GG, prad. Kudos for chugging on till... wow, 3:10am spinner : "while I'm not disappointed for England, well maybe a little. I'm happy for Scotland if it keeps raining" <strong>2:45pm</strong>: The umpires and reserve umpire are having a word with a couple of groundstaff members. No umbrellas above. Of course, they go up right after I type. There is a slight drizzle but Bairstow and Jordan are out. Topley too. Well, that's changing, rain's getting heavier. Prabhav: "Whenever you type the rain comes back..." Wish that wasn't true. Same for things changing right after being typed out. <strong>2:30pm</strong> There is a puddle on the cover, rest of it's wet too. So, not great signs. The skies have gotten darker and there's no one on the ground half an hour ahead of the next scheduled update. Aneel: "Next 30mins are crucial " Yeah, a few minutes in, a handful of members from the groundstaff are on the outfield. Covers still on though <B>2.17pm</B> The covers are coming off... this is not a drill. And, as feared, they are going back on again. Oh boy... There will be an inspection at 2.45pm. <B>No there won't, because it is raining again!</B> <B>2.09pm</B> The 2pm update is... that <strong>the next update will be at 3pm. </strong>Literally nothing to see here for now. <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/report/_/gameId/690575">Go and watch the Euros. </a>Or even<a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/golf/story/_/id/40351905/us-open-2024-pinehurst-third-round-questions-scottie-scheffler-rory-mcilroy"> the US Open golf...</a> <B>1.58pm</B> We are two minutes away from that proposed "update", but I think we know what it'll say. It's damp. And it's not going to be playable in a hurry. prakash: "can they order those super sopper things with 1 hour delivery on Amazon?" <B>1.48pm</B> Well... there's not a lot of news as yet, except the rain has been pretty heavy in the last 15 minutes. It's confirmed that this match <strong>needs to start by 4.46pm</strong>, for a five-overs contest, or it's curtains for England. The rain has eased a touch, but there is so much standing water on the outfield. That is the concern for England, for whom the clock is most definitely ticking now. <B>1.43pm</B> The patient has a pulse... or not Mark: "The pictures of the North Sound ground converting itself into a boating pond suggest that Scotland will shortly be celebrating." We shall see... the "update" is about half an hour away. <B>1.03pm</B> Right, this time the clock is ticking... and we have news, of sorts. "The next update" will be at 2pm local time, according to the ICC. That's not an inspection as such, but it might count as progress. Aditya: "Hi, just tuning in. does a washout mean England are eliminated irrespective of the Australia Scotland game?" It would mean exactly that. I believe the latest start time for a five-over contest would be<strong> approximately 4.45pm local time.</strong> So that is the ultimate cut-off of cut-offs. <B>12.56pm</B> There's a bit of movement on the covers at the moment. Just a bit of assessment from the groundstaff, as they work out how much standing water needs to be removed. The umpires are poking around with their umbrellas. The wait goes on. allie: "I was under the impression we start losing overs 90 minutes AFTER scheduled start of play which I thought was 13hrs ground time" Yes, I think you are right. Reset that clock! Sammo: "If the rain continues, is it even worth trying to analyse Eng's performance at this tournament? I feel we've learned so little" It's true. You'd have thought that Matthew Mott's position would be untenable in the event of an early elimination, but two washouts would mitigate that significantly. <B>12.50pm</B> The umpires are wandering out to take a look, which is encouraging - not so much that a start time is imminent, but that the rain has eased enough to make it worthwhile! brandon: "why have a cut off in 70 mins?! - surely thay can play until 10pm under lights." Well quite. If this was Wimbledon, you'd make up time in the schedule to play the backed-up games! To clarify, that cut-off refers to the limit for a full game. Any start after that will involve a reduction in overs. Ravi: "Feeling sad for Namibia. Three extra games for Scotland comes at the expense of one game of Namibia" Yes, this is a huge day for them too, first T20I against England and all that. Suffice to say, both teams will want to get out there and play! NRT: "England is better company to New Zealand and Pakistan. let's hope this match is abandoned so that they can plan a quick T20 Tri-Series between them " Stranger things have happened in this over-congested sport! <B>12.43pm</B> Yikes, that interview is cut short by an <em>absolute downpour!</em> It's barely possible to hear Hussain, Ward and Morgan on the host broadcast, as they don their brollies and try to keep talking shop. This is going to eat significantly into that cut-off time... <B>12.41pm</B> Phil Salt is talking to the host broadcaster. "You've got to be smart in your analysis of the opposition, there can't be any surprises on game day. There's no one thing that's [contributed to his form]. Jos and I know each other's games inside out. Keep it simple and communicate." <B>12.32pm</B> The groundstaff in Antigua are apparently optimistic. The rain has been of a showery variety, rather than the endless deluges that wrecked the Scotland contest in Barbados. Either way, the countdown clock begins... 88 minutes until we start to lose overs. And the shorter this contest, the better the prospects for Namibia to score an upset. Amol: "Only if ICC had transferred the games from Florida to Dallas. Everyone knew the bleak forecast atleast 2 days before" Yes, there is a lack of flexibility in such schedules, which might become something to consider if damp northern-hemisphere summers become the norm. When Lauderdale Airport was flooded on the eve of that leg, you did wonder if it was wise to persevere! Simon: "If England win the toss I'd rather see them bat first and go out blasting just in case of rain later. DLS always seems to work against the team chasing (hence why so many think Scotland would have won that 10 over match)" <B>12.30pm</B> Right, which way is this one headed? It's toss time in Antigua. <strong>Or not, as the covers are back on... </strong> <B>12.21pm</B> We're about ten minutes away from the toss. Stay tuned! Saifi: "If there's any rain predicted for next three hours, England must go to choose bowl first. That's the only way they can win it within the two hour duration " Indeed, that was a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/england-vs-oman-28th-match-group-b-1415728/full-scorecard">very successful formula in their last outing</a>. Anything that speeds the contest along is probably in their interests. Mark: "England have previous against Namibia. A laboured victory in a 50-over WC game that led to elimination, I believe. Problems with Burgers who seemed super-sized that day. Can't see it happening again..." Indeed. The puns wrote themselves in that tournament. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/flashes-in-the-world-cup-pan-284351>Halcyon days!</A> <B>12.13pm</B> Anyhow, the signs from Antigua are that a washout won't be the upshot. The shots from the ground show a sufficiency of blue sky on the horizon, even if one or two showers may yet roll across. Shadow-Shell: "@Vipin I don't know,  I feel like rain adds it's own natural flavor to the games" It certainly helps the grass grow. And yes, I've enjoyed the dominance of the bowlers at venues such as New York, even if it hasn't been the big-hitting spectacle we were promised! Desmo: "Anyone else, possibly including a certain Australian bowler named "Josh", doing a rain dance at the moment?" Absolutely not, this is a no-Schadenfreude zone, remember! <B>12.07pm</B> Bharat: "I know you won't publish it. I dare you to publish..Schadenfreude Miller? Really? Is there a worser way to show your fanatic patriotism to England? Why can't someone support Scotland to qualify just for the mere aspect that it makes the World Cup really the "World" cup? It's boring to watch same teams in the more serious rounds.. cometh a day when some associate team qualify beating India, I will still be happy for that team." Dare accepted. Over-reaction detected! Sure there are plenty of people rooting for Scotland either way, especially when they take the field against Australia this evening/tomorrow. But you can't pretend there wouldn't be one or two laughing at England in the event of a washout here... and I suspect you, Bharat, would be nailed firmly in that camp! <B>11.55am</B> The covers are coming off, which will be a significant relief to England. Jim: "@Miller. AUS-SCO is not "at the same venue tomorrow". It's today, Saturday. " I can't keep up with the ludicrous time-zones for this tournament. Suffice to say, it's tomorrow where I am, but today where I'm not! Joshua: "It's also not the same venue. Scotland/Australia is in St. Lucia. Sorry!" That's it, I quit... vipin gulati: "ICC should look into climate before giving the rights to host World Cup.  It takes all the fun away from these washed out matches " I fear you'd need to play on the moon to avoid the impact of climate change these days. And even if you did that, the atmosphere would be non-existent. Gettit? <strong>11.42am</strong> The early news from the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium is not promising (unless you're a fan of either Scotland or Schadenfreude...) But, there's still more than an hour until the start, and there's 90 minutes of spare time to factor in before we start losing overs. Maya: "Can't wait for this clash! It sounds a bit like a playoff - assuming that Aus beat Scotland - because a win will most likely take England to the super 8s! The India Canada game has just been washed out, sadly. Hope it doesn't play a spoilsport here!" Indeed,<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/canada-vs-india-33rd-match-group-a-1415733/live-cricket-score"> here's what didn't take place</a> in Lauderhill earlier today... <strong>11.30am</strong> Good morning all, welcome to the day of pre-reckoning. England's T20 World Cup progression hangs in the balance after their slow start to the campaign, and while there'll be no guarantees of a place in the Super Eight this afternoon - that will only be decided once Scotland have faced Australia <S>at this same venue tomorrow </s> somewhere, some time - anything less than victory will confirm they are toast. And so, welcome to the Thunderdome, Namibia, for the first meeting of these two teams in T20I history, and only their second in official international history, after their clash at <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-cup-2002-03-61124/england-vs-namibia-19th-match-65252/full-scorecard">the 2003 World Cup in South Africa</a>. For Jan-Berrie Burger and Rudi van Vuuren, read David Wiese and Ruben Trumpelmann. There's plenty quality in this Namibia line-up, but can they rattle a side that won at an obscene gallop in their last outing, against Oman two days ago? We will find out soon enough! The toss is coming up in just under an hour's time.

That's the only way they can win it within the two hour duration " Indeed, that was a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/england-vs-oman-28th-match-group-b-1415728/full-scorecard">very successful formula in their last outing</a>. Anything that speeds the contest along is probably in their interests. Mark: "England have previous against Namibia. A laboured victory in a 50-over WC game that led to elimination, I believe. Problems with Burgers who seemed super-sized that day. Can't see it happening again..." Indeed. The puns wrote themselves in that tournament. <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/flashes-in-the-world-cup-pan-284351>Halcyon days!</A> <B>12.13pm</B> Anyhow, the signs from Antigua are that a washout won't be the upshot. The shots from the ground show a sufficiency of blue sky on the horizon, even if one or two showers may yet roll across. Shadow-Shell: "@Vipin I don't know,  I feel like rain adds it's own natural flavor to the games" It certainly helps the grass grow. And yes, I've enjoyed the dominance of the bowlers at venues such as New York, even if it hasn't been the big-hitting spectacle we were promised! Desmo: "Anyone else, possibly including a certain Australian bowler named "Josh", doing a rain dance at the moment?" Absolutely not, this is a no-Schadenfreude zone, remember! <B>12.07pm</B> Bharat: "I know you won't publish it. I dare you to publish..Schadenfreude Miller? Really? Is there a worser way to show your fanatic patriotism to England? Why can't someone support Scotland to qualify just for the mere aspect that it makes the World Cup really the "World" cup? It's boring to watch same teams in the more serious rounds.. cometh a day when some associate team qualify beating India, I will still be happy for that team." Dare accepted. Over-reaction detected! Sure there are plenty of people rooting for Scotland either way, especially when they take the field against Australia this evening/tomorrow. But you can't pretend there wouldn't be one or two laughing at England in the event of a washout here... and I suspect you, Bharat, would be nailed firmly in that camp! <B>11.55am</B> The covers are coming off, which will be a significant relief to England. Jim: "@Miller. AUS-SCO is not "at the same venue tomorrow". It's today, Saturday. " I can't keep up with the ludicrous time-zones for this tournament. Suffice to say, it's tomorrow where I am, but today where I'm not! Joshua: "It's also not the same venue. Scotland/Australia is in St. Lucia. Sorry!" That's it, I quit... vipin gulati: "ICC should look into climate before giving the rights to host World Cup.  It takes all the fun away from these washed out matches " I fear you'd need to play on the moon to avoid the impact of climate change these days. And even if you did that, the atmosphere would be non-existent. Gettit? <strong>11.42am</strong> The early news from the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium is not promising (unless you're a fan of either Scotland or Schadenfreude...) But, there's still more than an hour until the start, and there's 90 minutes of spare time to factor in before we start losing overs. Maya: "Can't wait for this clash! It sounds a bit like a playoff - assuming that Aus beat Scotland - because a win will most likely take England to the super 8s! The India Canada game has just been washed out, sadly. Hope it doesn't play a spoilsport here!" Indeed,<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/canada-vs-india-33rd-match-group-a-1415733/live-cricket-score"> here's what didn't take place</a> in Lauderhill earlier today... <strong>11.30am</strong> Good morning all, welcome to the day of pre-reckoning. England's T20 World Cup progression hangs in the balance after their slow start to the campaign, and while there'll be no guarantees of a place in the Super Eight this afternoon - that will only be decided once Scotland have faced Australia <S>at this same venue tomorrow </s> somewhere, some time - anything less than victory will confirm they are toast. And so, welcome to the Thunderdome, Namibia, for the first meeting of these two teams in T20I history, and only their second in official international history, after their clash at <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-cup-2002-03-61124/england-vs-namibia-19th-match-65252/full-scorecard">the 2003 World Cup in South Africa</a>. For Jan-Berrie Burger and Rudi van Vuuren, read David Wiese and Ruben Trumpelmann. There's plenty quality in this Namibia line-up, but can they rattle a side that won at an obscene gallop in their last outing, against Oman two days ago? We will find out soon enough! The toss is coming up in just under an hour's time.

An air-shot from Salt, back of a length from Wiese and sits in the surface while seaming away. Misses an ambitious pull

<B>slower ball, nicked to the keeper!</B> Now this is just wonderful bowling. Wiese turns off all the pace, but finds the ideal line and length, a knuckleball floats like a leaf down at Salt's hard hands, and a palpable nick loops gently to the keeper. England are in a world of bother now!
Davy Cross: "Credit and Kudos to all the fans who have waited in the ground for this to happen. "

How does Trumpelmann follow that? He's got a knack of first-over wickets...

back of a length, Trumpelmann resists the temptation to swing it in Salt's arc, instead he induces a gentle back-foot poke to cover
