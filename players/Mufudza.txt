Naveen: "This series is a waste of time. Even though Sri Lanka underperformed recently, their track record against strong teams are evident. They should fought against the strong sides. This series will be one sided for sure. Sri Lanka will take all games home. " -- Zimbabwe have a strong record against SL though

 b Theekshana
Tapiwa Mufudza b Theekshana 1 (9b 0x4 0x6 7m) SR: 11.11
<B>over and out - Theekshana finishes with four!</b> Classical googly landing full outside off and turning in while Mufudza drives away from his body. Through the gap and the stumps are broken. <B>Sri Lanka need 209 to win</b>
<hr> <B>5.52pm</b> That's the fifth four-wicket haul for Theekshana in ODI cricket. The innings has been all Sri Lanka after Zimbabwe chose to bat, troubled only by the visiting captain Sean Ervine. His 82 moved this innings along in the company of Shumba (26) and Burl (31). Vandersay was also terrific on this turning surface, as was Madushanka with the early wicket and Chameera in his return spell. Can Sri Lanka finally take a lead? Will Zimbabwe produce a sterling fightback? Or will rain spoil another second innings? Join Himanshu soon for the chase.
