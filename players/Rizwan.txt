Getting ready to go post lunch. Nauman: "That's some really poor over rate by Aussies despite 4 overs from Lyon." Very ordinary. They have already lost WTC points in the Ashes for slow over-rates. They need to be careful here. Cummins revealed post Melbourne that he does keep and eye on it during games. Ahmed: "Pakistan played better cricket apart from the 4 mistakes in the morning session... No sarcasm intended at the Professor..." <strong>1pm</strong> Shaheen Shah Afridi has spoken to Channel Seven in Australia about why he is resting in this Test match. Australia with another clinical effort in the morning session after being asked to bowl first. The star-studded pace trio breathed fire as Abdullah Shafique and Saim Ayub went back to the pavilion without troubling the scorers. Australia could not have asked for a better start to this Warner's Test farewell. The bowling accuracy was top-notch, and Pakistan's top-order shot selection wasn't spot-on. Shan Masood is still out there, looking the most comfortable among the lot. Will he be able to convert his start into a big hundred? His team direly needs him to play a grinding knock. It's time for me to have a cup of coffee. Join Alex in 30 minutes for the post-lunch session Parabola: "These 2 just need to hang on and build. This test isn't over by any stretch of the imagination." Kiran Thapa: "The positive finding for Pakistan is great captain in Shan Masood, leading from the front." Kath: "You have to remember that Aus were 4 for 16 (or something like that) and still won." we remember but does the Pakistan team as well?

orkydd: "Ah yes, Over rates. Best if the penalties affect a team's position in the game. Let's say there are to be 540 deliveries in 6 hours play. So 0.67 mins per delivery. The scoreboard can indicate when teams are ahead or behind the required number of deliveries. If a team is more than 2 deliveries behind the required rate, then a one run penalty should apply for each delivery until they are back on schedule. Third umpire can make the adjustments for wickets, injury delays, umpire stuck in lift etc"

orkydd: "Ah yes, Over rates. Best if the penalties affect a team's position in the game. Let's say there are to be 540 deliveries in 6 hours play. So 0.67 mins per delivery. The scoreboard can indicate when teams are ahead or behind the required number of deliveries. If a team is more than 2 deliveries behind the required rate, then a one run penalty should apply for each delivery until they are back on schedule. Third umpire can make the adjustments for wickets, injury delays, umpire stuck in lift etc"

Here we go, the players are heading out to the middle. Rizwan is marking his guard, Babar at the other end. Looks like Wood will take the new ball from the Pavilion End. Slip in, deep third <b>6.25pm:</b> The weather in south London continues to <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaF5MAY1Wow target=_blank>hold</a>. Just time to stick the kettle on and make one last brew before the action gets going <b>6.15pm:</b> So, whisper it, but we might have an outbreak of cricket between the showers. The Oval has cleaned up nicely after that downpour an hour ago, though the glowering skies will probably be more to the liking of England's quicks than the Pakistan openers. Speaking of which, it looks like the old firm of Babar and Mo Riz being united at the top of the order, after Saim Ayub's form (<a href=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/1161031.html?class=3;template=results;type=batting;view=innings;year=2024>two scores above 30 in 12 innings</a>) made his spot untenable. Usman Khan, who has four hundreds in 40 T20 innings and courted the wrath of UAE officials by performing a U-turn on his plan to qualify for them, will get a chance to stake a claim at No. 3 "England's XI looks strong," reckons Nick. "I just wonder if Duckett wouldn't be a better pick than Livingstone (he's not really performed for a long time). Jacks can deal with the all-round spin, with Ali. Also, I wonder how Jordan will perform. Topley might be a better pick?" Livingstone is at a bit of a crossroads, <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/england-liam-livingstone-big-hits-headingley-return-1434612>as Matt wrote at the start of the series</a>. Jordan being picked for batting depth, I think "Why not give Abrar a go when you don't have Imad available, you'll be needing him badly in the Caribbean, instead opting for Shadab who looks out of sorts and another bad day would take him away from that starting eleven in New York, what is going on?" wonders a bewildered Muhammad But never fear, Abdul has the answer: "Many will comment on Shadab's inclusion again [correct]. Prior to this series, Pakistan said they will experiment. They want Shadab to find his form. Thereby giving him chance." <b>6.01pm: England win the toss and bowl</b>, Buttler says there is "a little bit of green grass, little bit of weather around" and his side are looking to chase. Wood does indeed replace Topley in the XI. Babar Azam says he would have bowled, too. Pakistan "batted well in patches" in the second game, but they are looking to improve. Two changes for the tourists, Usman Khan and Naseem Shah in for Saim Ayub and Imad Wasim. The PCB have issued an update on Imad, specifically, saying he has "been advised to take rest and will not participate in the fourth T20I against England" after experiencing "discomfort in his right rib cage" while batting in the nets. <b>England:</b> 1 Phil Salt, 2 Jos Buttler (capt/wk), 3 Will Jacks, 4 Jonny Bairstow, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood <b>Pakistan:</b> 1 Mohammad Rizwan, 2 Babar Azam (capt), 3 Usman Khan, 4 Fakhar Zaman, 5 Shadab Khan, 6 Azam Khan (wk), 7 Iftikhar Ahmed, 8 Shaheen Afridi, 9 Haris Rauf, 10 Mohammad Amir, 11 Naseem Shah <b>5.55pm:</b> Sounds reasonably encouraging that The Oval might dodge the worst of the weather tonight... keep those digits crossed and stand by for the toss coming up shortly. Matt says that Jofra Archer has marked out his run, too, so Wood replacing Reece Topley would be the one change from Saturday's game at Edgbaston <b>5.40pm:</b> Some reports of hot covers action, courtesy Matt: "Big sheets being peeled back by groundstaff right now. Bizarrely Oval one of the few UK venues that doesn't use the hovers." He adds that the players are out on the field, going about their warm-ups. "Jordan marking out a run-up, Livingstone visualising. Wood also marking one. Jos returns as captain." Speaking of Buttler, back after the birth of his third child, here is Matt's piece on <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/jos-buttler-england-captain-wants-to-rediscover-joy-of-t20-batting-1435756>how he rediscovered the joy of six-hitting</a>, with the help of a little-known Indian coach, Siddhartha "Sid" Lahiri "This match should tell us whether to play Shadab and Azam in the WC or not. Both have been extremely mediocre lately. Publish this comment as this is my first in a decade since I started following cricket on cricinfo. PS. On my way to Kia Oval for this encounter. Looking forward to a Babar and Butler power show!" Today's your lucky day, Asad Shoaib. Now we just need the weather to hold <b>5.30pm:</b> Okay, better news. Matt reports that it has stopped raining already - although <a href=https://x.com/miller_cricket/status/1796209801866678708?s=46&t=TWcBtaDXonNnHZhk0AZ6YQ target=_blank>there's a chance more is on the way</a>. The covers are currently on, we'll have to sit tight and see if conditions improve for the toss in half an hour's time "Just had rain in West London, ominous clouds here too but doing an anti-rain dance, which includes putting out a giant fan to suck in the clouds over here, away from The Oval. Thus if there is play it will be down to me. Honest." Sterling work, Badhat. The medal's in the post Here's Sameer Okaz: "Good Evening Alan! 3 washouts in a 4 match series is very heartbreaking for us fans, it was like a warm-up series for the two teams but it's a good warm-up for fans to prepare for the T20 world cup washouts as the weather isn't looking good next month too as we have seen in the warm-ups." Cricket and bad weather, inextricably linked. Although I reckon we should get some sort of game tonight <b>5.20pm:</b> Evening, guvnors/guvnesses. England Men are set for their first T20I in the capital since 2014 - so long as the rain stays away from the Kennington area. On the subject of which, Matt Roller is already in situ, and has this: "There's some very ominous cloud from the Vauxhall/Harleyford Road side of the crowd but hopefully will pass over..." Followed about two minutes later by: "Just started raining!!" So after washouts in the first and third T20Is, it looks like we could be in for another night of watching the skies. Don't go anywhere

The PCB have issued an update on Imad, specifically, saying he has "been advised to take rest and will not participate in the fourth T20I against England" after experiencing "discomfort in his right rib cage" while batting in the nets. <b>England:</b> 1 Phil Salt, 2 Jos Buttler (capt/wk), 3 Will Jacks, 4 Jonny Bairstow, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Moeen Ali, 7 Liam Livingstone, 8 Chris Jordan, 9 Jofra Archer, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Mark Wood <b>Pakistan:</b> 1 Mohammad Rizwan, 2 Babar Azam (capt), 3 Usman Khan, 4 Fakhar Zaman, 5 Shadab Khan, 6 Azam Khan (wk), 7 Iftikhar Ahmed, 8 Shaheen Afridi, 9 Haris Rauf, 10 Mohammad Amir, 11 Naseem Shah <b>5.55pm:</b> Sounds reasonably encouraging that The Oval might dodge the worst of the weather tonight... keep those digits crossed and stand by for the toss coming up shortly. Matt says that Jofra Archer has marked out his run, too, so Wood replacing Reece Topley would be the one change from Saturday's game at Edgbaston <b>5.40pm:</b> Some reports of hot covers action, courtesy Matt: "Big sheets being peeled back by groundstaff right now. Bizarrely Oval one of the few UK venues that doesn't use the hovers." He adds that the players are out on the field, going about their warm-ups. "Jordan marking out a run-up, Livingstone visualising. Wood also marking one. Jos returns as captain." Speaking of Buttler, back after the birth of his third child, here is Matt's piece on <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/jos-buttler-england-captain-wants-to-rediscover-joy-of-t20-batting-1435756>how he rediscovered the joy of six-hitting</a>, with the help of a little-known Indian coach, Siddhartha "Sid" Lahiri "This match should tell us whether to play Shadab and Azam in the WC or not. Both have been extremely mediocre lately. Publish this comment as this is my first in a decade since I started following cricket on cricinfo. PS. On my way to Kia Oval for this encounter. Looking forward to a Babar and Butler power show!" Today's your lucky day, Asad Shoaib. Now we just need the weather to hold <b>5.30pm:</b> Okay, better news. Matt reports that it has stopped raining already - although <a href=https://x.com/miller_cricket/status/1796209801866678708?s=46&t=TWcBtaDXonNnHZhk0AZ6YQ target=_blank>there's a chance more is on the way</a>. The covers are currently on, we'll have to sit tight and see if conditions improve for the toss in half an hour's time "Just had rain in West London, ominous clouds here too but doing an anti-rain dance, which includes putting out a giant fan to suck in the clouds over here, away from The Oval. Thus if there is play it will be down to me. Honest." Sterling work, Badhat. The medal's in the post Here's Sameer Okaz: "Good Evening Alan! 3 washouts in a 4 match series is very heartbreaking for us fans, it was like a warm-up series for the two teams but it's a good warm-up for fans to prepare for the T20 world cup washouts as the weather isn't looking good next month too as we have seen in the warm-ups." Cricket and bad weather, inextricably linked. Although I reckon we should get some sort of game tonight <b>5.20pm:</b> Evening, guvnors/guvnesses. England Men are set for their first T20I in the capital since 2014 - so long as the rain stays away from the Kennington area. On the subject of which, Matt Roller is already in situ, and has this: "There's some very ominous cloud from the Vauxhall/Harleyford Road side of the crowd but hopefully will pass over..." Followed about two minutes later by: "Just started raining!!" So after washouts in the first and third T20Is, it looks like we could be in for another night of watching the skies. Don't go anywhere

More telling is Pakistan have only had 3 bowlers take more than 1 wicket whereas NZ has 6 bowlers who've taken 3 or more wickets. If you're not taking wickets you can't build pressure and you're going to lose games." Hassan : "The problem with Pakistan is, they are hiding their middle order weakness with openers." Ahmad: "It's 3:20 am here in ksa, supporting Pakistan even after losing straight four games and a extremely poor start :(" Shaizi mir: "So we woke up at 5 am with an alarm for this? 3 overs 4 run 1 out ok" Kashif: "Pakistan will post 140. I get feeling that today my comment will be published." Memon: "Looks like Shaheen made the wrong decision of opting for bat first today. He could have taken advantage of the pitch first which Nz is taking now. And Santner also mentioned that in 2nd innings there is a chance of higher score."

Gets down low and <strong>clobbers </strong>it high and handsome over square leg for a gorgeous boundary, one bounce over the rope and <strong>Pakistan win by seven wickets. </strong>
So, in the end, it proved to be a walk in the park for Pakistan and they weren't really tested in this game. Michael Bracewell said, New Zealand pride themselves on fighting until the last ball. After spending some time out there and assessing the conditions, we can expect them to compete better tomorrow. Pakistan will continue to try different combinations and experiments to prepare for the T20 World Cup in June. That's it from us for tonight. We'll be back tomorrow for the third T20I at Rawalpindi. It's time for me, Rvel Zahid, to say goodbye on behalf of Thilak Rama <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> In Pindi, it's crucial to set the tone in first six overs. The way Naseem, Shaheen and Amir bowled was outstanding. We will experiment and try different combinations in batting and bowling; will try players at different spots and we'll finalize the team come the time of Ireland and England series. On paper everybody looks a match winner in Pakistan team. Youngsters always bring energy but you need experience as well. We try to play according to the conditions and execute our plans accordingly. We have 10 matches, will try to tick all departments of the game. We make some mistakes in every game but we try to sit and discuss that. We want to do well in all departments and work on it on a daily basis. <strong>Michael Bracewell, New Zealand Captain: </strong> We didn't score quite enough runs. We were little bit slow to adapt to the surface and put ourselves under pressure in the end. You want guys to learn from situation. We got a game tomorrow and we need to learn quickly. We pride ourselves in fighting right till the end; we did that with the ball and in the field <strong>Shaheen Afridi, Player of the Match</strong>: I was bowling after 36 days. It's not easy to get back into rhythm straightaway but I had belief in myself and stuck to my guns. It stops swinging after one over in T20 cricket so I bowled according to the wicket and what conditions demanded from me. (On healthy competition in the side) Pakistan cricket is getting better (after the additions of players) and it's a good omen for us before the World Cup. Pakistan did this at a canter. 91 was never going to be enough on this batting-friendly wicket. Mohammad Rizwan anchored the innings and some new faces got valuable time in the middle and got their first taste of international cricket. Irfan Khan Niazi looked unfazed at the international level and continued his PSL form. The game was set up by Pakistan's bowlers, who were too good for the severely depleted New Zealand side. They couldn't exert any pressure and lost wickets at regular intervals mustering a subpar total. Mohammad Amir assessed the conditions quickly and used his slow balls perfectly, while Shaheen Afridi got the angle from round the wicket working well for him and speared in some superb yorkers. Abrar Ahmed found his radar right away and got decent grip off the surface while Shadab had a fun outing too

Gets down low and <strong>clobbers </strong>it high and handsome over square leg for a gorgeous boundary, one bounce over the rope and <strong>Pakistan win by seven wickets. </strong>
So, in the end, it proved to be a walk in the park for Pakistan and they weren't really tested in this game. Michael Bracewell said, New Zealand pride themselves on fighting until the last ball. After spending some time out there and assessing the conditions, we can expect them to compete better tomorrow. Pakistan will continue to try different combinations and experiments to prepare for the T20 World Cup in June. That's it from us for tonight. We'll be back tomorrow for the third T20I at Rawalpindi. It's time for me, Rvel Zahid, to say goodbye on behalf of Thilak Rama <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> In Pindi, it's crucial to set the tone in first six overs. The way Naseem, Shaheen and Amir bowled was outstanding. We will experiment and try different combinations in batting and bowling; will try players at different spots and we'll finalize the team come the time of Ireland and England series. On paper everybody looks a match winner in Pakistan team. Youngsters always bring energy but you need experience as well. We try to play according to the conditions and execute our plans accordingly. We have 10 matches, will try to tick all departments of the game. We make some mistakes in every game but we try to sit and discuss that. We want to do well in all departments and work on it on a daily basis. <strong>Michael Bracewell, New Zealand Captain: </strong> We didn't score quite enough runs. We were little bit slow to adapt to the surface and put ourselves under pressure in the end. You want guys to learn from situation. We got a game tomorrow and we need to learn quickly. We pride ourselves in fighting right till the end; we did that with the ball and in the field <strong>Shaheen Afridi, Player of the Match</strong>: I was bowling after 36 days. It's not easy to get back into rhythm straightaway but I had belief in myself and stuck to my guns. It stops swinging after one over in T20 cricket so I bowled according to the wicket and what conditions demanded from me.

Sagor: "Under Babar captaincy, Pakistan was the finalist and semifinalist in the last 2 T20 world Cup. Under babar captaincy, Pakistan win against india first time in a world cup match.  Pakistan first chase 200  score under Babar captaincy and if i not wrong Babar made century in that innings. I can write more but i feel its totally waste of time because its a new trend to blame Babar in any matters."

Touqir: "This leg side shot will be end of Saim Ayub's career! His foolish fascination with this shot is hurting him and eventually PAK. He hasn't been able to make an impact in his role because he got out trying to play the blind shot 9 out of 10 times." The bounce might be troubling him, just not able to time that shot well this series
