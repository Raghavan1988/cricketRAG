Nauman: "That's some really poor over rate by Aussies despite 4 overs from Lyon." Very ordinary. They have already lost WTC points in the Ashes for slow over-rates. They need to be careful here. Cummins revealed post Melbourne that he does keep and eye on it during games. Ahmed: "Pakistan played better cricket apart from the 4 mistakes in the morning session... No sarcasm intended at the Professor..." <strong>1pm</strong> Shaheen Shah Afridi has spoken to Channel Seven in Australia about why he is resting in this Test match. Australia with another clinical effort in the morning session after being asked to bowl first. The star-studded pace trio breathed fire as Abdullah Shafique and Saim Ayub went back to the pavilion without troubling the scorers. Australia could not have asked for a better start to this Warner's Test farewell. The bowling accuracy was top-notch, and Pakistan's top-order shot selection wasn't spot-on. Shan Masood is still out there, looking the most comfortable among the lot. Will he be able to convert his start into a big hundred? His team direly needs him to play a grinding knock. It's time for me to have a cup of coffee. Join Alex in 30 minutes for the post-lunch session Parabola: "These 2 just need to hang on and build. This test isn't over by any stretch of the imagination." Kiran Thapa: "The positive finding for Pakistan is great captain in Shan Masood, leading from the front." Kath: "You have to remember that Aus were 4 for 16 (or something like that) and still won." we remember but does the Pakistan team as well?

USA will start with spin. ESPNcricinfo's T20 Time:Out is now LIVE. Join Wasim Jaffer & Urooj Mumtaz on our pre-show. <strong>USA:</strong> Steven Taylor, Monank Patel (capt, wk), Andries Gous, Aaron Jones, Nitish Kumar, Corey Anderson, Harmeet Singh, Jasdeep Singh, Nosthush Kenjige, Saurabh Netravalkar, Ali Khan <strong>Pakistan:</strong> Babar Azam (capt), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir, Haris Rauf <strong>Babar Azam calls heads, tails it is. USA opt to bowl.</strong> "Chasing here is easier," says USA captain Monank Patel. "The way we chased down total was entertaining. Have momentum, want to continue that. Excited for this challenge." One change. Nostush Kenjige gets a game. Babar likens this to "Test match conditions" and would've loved to bowl first. "Good to see sun is out, last 3-4 days, haven't seen the sun shine. We're playing four quicks." <b> 9.45am local (7.45pm PST) </b> This edition of the T20 World Cup marks the comeback of Mohammad Amir. Fifteen years ago, he bowled a seismic over to set Pakistan on their way to the title. Now he's the elder statesman of their bowling pack. Osman Samiuddin <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/mohammad-amir-and-the-spirit-of-lord-s-2009-1435134">caught up with Mohammad Amir. </a> Will he slot in straightaway? We'll find out in less than 10 minutes. <b> 9.35am (7.35pm PST) </b> The surface offered early seam movement in each of the first two games with decent bounce and carry, with the opening game - held at this venue - throwing up the two highest scores of the tournament so far. Both sides will be hoping it's anything but the kind of deck we saw in New York last night. Both sides have had contrasting build-ups. USA are riding high after their stunning 2-1 series win over Bangladesh in the build-up to the tournament. They also beat Canada in the opening game right here in Dallas. Pakistan have struggled to get a proper training session in, let alone an actual game, warm-up or official. Rain in Dallas for much of the past week forced Pakistan to move two practice sessions to makeshift indoor facilities. They also arrived late into the USA, because they chose to play Ireland and England in six T20Is in the UK instead. And those games didn't exactly go to plan. Now, adding to their woes, they'll take the field without the injured Imad Wasim, who was brought out of retirement specifically for his experience of having played here in the Caribbean, particularly, through the CPL. In fact, seven members of the current squad have <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/pakistan-have-a-big-advantage-in-the-2024-t20-world-cup-inside-information-1435560">"inside information"</a> courtesy their extensive knowledge of the conditions in the Caribbean. <b>9.10am local (7.10pm PST) </B> Hello and a warm welcome to ESPNcricinfo's ball-by-ball coverage of the T20 World Cup.
