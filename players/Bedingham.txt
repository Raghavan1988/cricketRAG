<strong>10.58am</strong> Good day, people! I'm waiting for my coffee to kick in, and South Africa will expect some fight to kick in from their inexperienced batting line-up. Thanks Ashish. Southee has the ball to start the day with just one slip and a gully. Let's get this started Just about 10 minutes to go before the start of play on day three, and here's Vishal with hopefully a steaming cup of coffee to guide you through the first hour or so. Neil: "Even if New Zealand manage to roll South Africa I doubt they'd enforce the follow-on.  Better to make South Africa toil in the field for a couple of sessions and bowl at them on a deteriorating pitch.  New Zealand do have 4 spin bowling options (Santner, Phillips, Ravindra, and Williamson) " <strong>10.50am</strong> After Rachin Ravindra waxed lyrical about how it was <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/pure-batting-bliss-rachin-ravindra-lauds-his-unbelievable-idol-kane-williamson-1419630">'pure batting bliss'</a> to share a huge stand with his 'idol' Kane Williamson at the end of day one, it was the senior batter's turn to return the favour on day two. Williamson called Ravindra a 'class act' and how the team has loved his attitude. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/kane-williamson-all-praise-for-class-act-rachin-ravindra-his-temperament-speaks-volumes-1419801">Here's more</a>. <b>10.40am</b> After four sessions of circumspect cricket, New Zealand notched up a gear in the second session yesterday. Rachin Ravindra reached his maiden Test double hundred, also claiming the highest score by a New Zealand batter for his maiden Test century when he went past Matthew Sinclair's 214. South Africa captain Neil Brand took 6 for 119 but New Zealand amassed 511.
