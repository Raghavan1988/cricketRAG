"This week is complete work from home for me. So watching early hours cricket is just heaven for me. Watching this game now, will watch the AUSvWI game alternatively and end with some BPL" Sounds like a day, Mustafa!

<strong>Dream ball made to look even better by Fortuin being bamboozled</strong>. Length ball drifting in towards leg stump, 96ks, but only to turn away upon landing. Fortuin had exposed all the stumps but decided he had to try and defend that as it was too good a ball. Tried pushing it towards cover, ball ended hitting top of off. Motie pumps his fists after striking again in a match-defining spell
