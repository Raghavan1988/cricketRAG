Sasikanth: "Avesh's bowling action and his grunt make it feel like he should be bowling a lot faster than low 130s. Someone who primarily relies on seam movement needs to be in the early 140s or in the late 130s at worst. I am pretty sure more trained eyes might be able to identify some inefficiencies in his action. He is a strongly built guy and shouldn't be maxing out at 135 kph."

<strong>de Zorzi, fittingly, finishes with a six! Mukesh steps onto the boundary cushion and that sort of sumps up India's day!</strong> In the slot on middle and leg. de Zorzi gets his front foot out of the way and swings for the hills. Does not time it as well as he would have liked but gets enough elevation and power to force Mukesh - stood at the deep mid wicket fence - to trod on the boundary cushion as he took the catch. South Africa win by eight wickets. The series is alive and it will be decided in Paarl on December 21!
<strong>8:20pm</strong> Right. That brings us to the end of our coverage for this game. Hope you enjoyed it as much as we loved bringing it to you. Until next time, which will be the decider in Paarl on December 21, this is me (Shashwat) signing off on behalf of Ranjith, Sidharth Monga, Vairavan and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Goodbye, take care! <b>Aiden Markram, South Africa captain:</b> (On the game) A lot better than a couple of days ago. Much better overall performance. Much better with the ball and in the field. It was going around when the openers went out to bat. They put up a 100-run partnership and set up the game - that was great. (On the early bowling changes) The breeze played a bit of a factor. It was a fresh wicket so we expected it to go around. Nandre was being wasted from that end, thought he might as well bowl from the other end and throw rockets. It was fairly simple otherwise - bowl in the right areas and get the most out of the wicket. Not too sure (about the par score). Always felt we were in the game with the ball. It was a tough wicket to bat on but if you applied yourself, you could get big runs. Maybe high 200s (was a par score). (On de Zorzi) It was huge for him. To put in a performance like that, to remain not out at the end and to remember how the crowd was to him, we were pretty much in awe. It was fantastic to watch. Hopefully the first of many for him, and the dressing room enjoyed it. (On how they turned things around after the first ODI) That was not an acceptable performance. We let ourselves down in the first game. Strong emphasis to chase well, and the mindset was to chase it down well. Much more confident unit, I would assume, after tonight. <b>KL Rahul, India captain:</b> (On what he wants to change from today) Probably win the toss (smiles). There was a bit of help at the start. It was tough to bat on but a couple of us got set. Had we gone on, we could have gotten 50-60 runs extra and that would have made a difference. (On if 270 was par) When we batted, we thought even 240-250 would have been good. With a set batter, we might have gotten those runs. We lost wickets at crucial times. (On finding the right balance between caution and aggression) Each individual's game-plan and what they feel comfortable doing, as a team, you have to trust that. Have complete clarity and try to execute it. There is no right or wrong in cricket and you try to do the job for your team. (On the bowling display) There was a bit of help in the first ten overs. We beat the bat a lot. We could not hold on to one edge. Things might have been different had we held onto that. Not as much help as the first innings though. (Message before the third ODI) We leave what happens on the ground and will try and focus on the next game. <b>Tony de Zorzi, Player of the Match:</b> It was a flood of emotions (getting to the hundred). Hopefully my mom is watching, and she is back from work. Lot of stuff goes through your head. You just want to thank the people that have been watching out for you and have backed you. JP (Duminy) spoke to me about what they wanted from me and I tried to implement that. Would have loved to go on at the Wanderers too. Glad I was able to do it today. (On how he describes himself as a player) Not sure how I will do that. I think I am adaptable, decent at adapting to different conditions. Still need to get better, though. (If the feeling of the hundred has sunk in yet) Probably not. But cool to go to the band and to see them with everyone clapping. I will never forget a moment like this. Here's Sampath with a mind-boggling stat: Tony de Zorzi's 119* today is higher than South Africa's previous three ODI totals vs India - 116 (Johannesburg), 83 (Kolkata), 99 (Delhi). <strong>8pm</strong> A thoroughly commanding victory for the hosts. It was set up by their bowlers but take nothing away from de Zorzi, who gutsed it out in testing conditions early before timing his counter-attack to perfection. He put the Indian bowlers, Kuldeep in particular, under pressure and never relented. Whenever India presented boundary-scoring opportunities, he pounced, and he was content to milk the bowling at other times. Hendricks, despite not being as fluent as he usually is, also played a part, notching up 52 and putting together 130 for the first wicket. As for India, they did ask questions with the new ball but their fielding let them down at that stage. Thereafter, they lacked penetration and could not really string together enough overs of pressure to force mistakes. The bowlers did not have a huge total on the board to work with, although they would hope for some of the incisiveness that shone through at Johannesburg to return for the decider in a couple of days' time. Stating the obvious here but South Africa batted, bowled and fielded better than India today, and unsurprisingly, won at a canter.

<strong>de Zorzi, fittingly, finishes with a six! Mukesh steps onto the boundary cushion and that sort of sumps up India's day!</strong> In the slot on middle and leg. de Zorzi gets his front foot out of the way and swings for the hills. Does not time it as well as he would have liked but gets enough elevation and power to force Mukesh - stood at the deep mid wicket fence - to trod on the boundary cushion as he took the catch. South Africa win by eight wickets. The series is alive and it will be decided in Paarl on December 21!
<strong>8:20pm</strong> Right. That brings us to the end of our coverage for this game. Hope you enjoyed it as much as we loved bringing it to you.

Goodbye, take care! <b>Aiden Markram, South Africa captain:</b> (On the game) A lot better than a couple of days ago. Much better overall performance. Much better with the ball and in the field.

fired full on the stumps, de Zorzi is right back into the crease as he keeps it out. <b> Lunch on Day 2 </b>
<b>12.30pm </b> South Africa will be pleased with the position they're in after losing Markram early. Bumrah and Siraj went full throttle in a tremendous exhibition of swing and seam under overcast skies, but de Zorzi and Elgar have shown plenty of pluck. Earlier in the day, India added some vital runs - 47 of them - to finish with 245. KL Rahul struck his eighth Test ton, arguably his best, to lift India out of choppy waters. They'll need their bowlers to step up post lunch to ensure South Africa don't walk away with the advantage at the end of day two. Join us in about 35 minutes.
