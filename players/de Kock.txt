One of the big talking points in the lead-in has been Temba Bavuma's fitness. He sounded hopeful yesterday. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-the-complex-reality-of-bavuma-s-world-cup-semi-final-1408780">Firdose has added some context to his World Cup story</a>. Meanwhile, for Australia, it's Marnus v Marcus. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/marnus-labuschagne-vs-marcus-stoinis-australia-s-big-call-for-odi-world-cup-semi-final-1408433">Which way will it go</a>? (Still time for you to vote). And <strong>the covers are being removed</strong> Harishkumar: "Who will reach final if both the days are washed out?" - South Africa, as they finished higher in the group stage. <b>12.30pm</b> Hello everyone and welcome to coverage of the second World Cup semi-final from Kolkata where we will find out who meets India in the final on Sunday. It's Australia against South Africa - <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/australia-vs-south-africa-2nd-semi-final-1384438/match-preview">a team with a mighty record in World Cups against one that, shall we say, hasn't quite got over the line</a>. I believe these two sides met in quite a close game in 1999, but can't quite remember how that one played out. I'm sure they'll be a reminder or two during the day. Although, given the weather, perhaps what happened in 2003 will be more relevant? Be careful with those DLS sheets. I'm Andrew McGlashan and along with Alan Gardner will bring you all the action today (and maybe tomorrow). And so, on the topic of the weather, because that's what you are all googling, can tell you it's not currently raining but the ground is fully covered. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-world-cup-2023-semi-final-south-africa-vs-australia-kolkata-weather-forecast-reserve-day-info-1408720">Here's the details of reserve days and how it works.</a> Roshan Sherigar: "This is a World Cup of revenge.

Meanwhile, Brandon King informs that <strong>Alick Athanaze makes his T20I debut for West Indies</strong>. Also, Andile Phehlukwayo was not considered for selection for today's match due to a respiratory tract infection, while Tabraiz Shamsi has been ruled out as a precautionary measure due to a right lower limb soft tissue injury. <strong>1.15pm</strong> The most important T20 of the day... after the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/indian-premier-league-2024-1410320/kolkata-knight-riders-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-final-1426312/full-scorecard">most popular T20</a> is done in a flash. KKR hammer tournament favourites SRH to lift the IPL trophy for the third time; and while West Indies hosting South Africa in a dead-rubber T20I is nowhere near the glitz and glamour of even the yet-to-begin presentation ceremony of the IPL final, there is still the T20 World Cup to build-up for. Welcome to Kingston for the third and final T20I of the series, before both sides are boosted by the power of the IPL returnees ahead of the big tournament.
bowls on a fullish length on middle and leg, as de Kock clips towards short fine leg

Shot: DEFENDED

ohh, Hosein slows it down, and bowls on a length around off. There is an appeal for lbw, but it is turned down. <strong>King reviews</strong> after being convinced, though. The ball goes on with the angle from around the stumps, and hints to straighten back in. De Kock is back in the crease to dab at it, and replays show a faint inside edge on to his pad. So West Indies lose the review

De Kock went for the shot early and missed the ball, and was hit on the side of the knee of his front pad. There is no bat or glove on it, and replays show the ball would have hit leg stump.
