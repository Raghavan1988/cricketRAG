<strong>6:28pm</strong> The Afghanistan players are in a huddle on the edge of the boundary rope, with Shahidi giving out some last-minute instructions. Bavuma, who was not moving very freely in the field, will open the batting alongside de Kock. Looks like it will be a trial by spin from one end (at least). Mujeeb to start off proceedings for Afghanistan. Around the wicket to de Kock, and Mujeeb has a slip in place - here we go! <strong>6:15pm</strong> Hello and welcome back, everyone. Afghanistan have something to play with, even if it might not be as many as they would have wanted at the start. Having crumbled to 116-6 at one point, though, they will take this and hope that their spinners wreak havoc on a pitch that has turned. South Africa do not have a great record chasing in ODIs this year either, and it will be a good test of their chasing mettle, especially with a semi-final looming. Plenty to look forward to, as always, so grab your choice of food and drink, and hop on!

<strong>big appeal!</strong> Length delivery angled into off stump. de Kock looks for the reverse sweep and seems to make no contact. Gets pinned on the pads but the umpire is unmoved.

Sakib will open the bowling for Bangladesh. De Kock on strike for South Africa, and he has a slip for him. <strong>10.23am</strong> The teams are out for their respective national anthems. The crowd in New York is majorly sporting Bangladesh's green. Bangladesh first, followed by South Africa's anthem. Mirza: "Bangladesh can beat South Africa here if the play sensibly, and South Africa can panic, as we know from past world cup games" Marthinus Grobb: "As a loyal South African supporter, I am glad to see that the Proteas have been able to chase two totals successfully. After the poor performances in the ODI world cup chasing, it has been a concern for us. Let us not invoke the "C"-word this tournament... please!" --- Say C for chase!

Quinton de Kock lbw b Motie 19 (18b 3x4 0x6 33m) SR: 105.55
goes for the reverse sweep, and it is given out lbw after he misses it. But <strong>de Kock reviews</strong>! It was bowled a bit short on off, and turned in slightly. De Kock went for the shot early and missed the ball, and was hit on the side of the knee of his front pad. There is no bat or glove on it, and replays show the ball would have hit leg stump. Motie had bowled it much quicker - at 101kph - and got the reward
