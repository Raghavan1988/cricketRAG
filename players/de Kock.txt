Right, we are just about ready to rumble. A place in the World Cup final on the line. Zubair: "3:30am in Toronto, wouldn't miss this for the world. Red bull(s) ready, day off work, settling in to watch us FINALLY shed that chokers tag,! Nkosi sikele iAfrika!" <b>1.50pm</b> Not long to go now so settle in with your preferred beverage (or while hiding the screen from the boss depending on the time zone). G-Rant: "Despite any psychological pressure that might be on SA I think they have been the better side. As an Australian I've very concerned at the lacklustre form of our pace bowlers and our inability to take wickets in the first 10 overs. Chasing a lot of runs might be too much in a semi final." Sami: "Decision to bat first under cloudy conditions reminds me of 1999 final when Pak decided to bat first because of their chasing weaknesses." <b>1.45pm</b> Gokul Pradeep V: "Great to see Coetzee getting the nod ahead of Ngidi in a knockout match. Can be a genuine X factor for SA!!" Danish: "If there was ever a toss SA needed to win it was this one. They'll be breathing a sigh or two of relief!" Just don't get rolled Sriram N: "Bavuma is a bit shaky against spin as well - Quinton's off spin weakness is known - why not Aus start with Maxi?" It's a very interesting notion, but suspect the cloud cover will mean the quicks early on <b>1.35pm</b> Nathan: "I don't mind Australia chasing at all. Overcast conditions right now, ball may swing a bit. Chance to create some chaos with the new ball. Possible dew can be a factor later on. Not the worst toss to lose?" Andrew Miller is all over <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-24-1367856/australia-vs-south-africa-2nd-semi-final-1384438/live-match-blog">the Live Report today</a> and very excited to be there, so feel free to pop over for further insight and analysis. <b>1.32pm</b> <b>South Africa win the toss and will bat</b>. Temba Bavuma says weather came into his thinking, but going with the team's strength. Says he's not 100% fit. "Will have to be good enough," he adds. Pat Cummins says he would have batted first as well, but notes the overheads that may help with the ball. Marnus Labuschagne makes the cut ahead of Marcus Stoinis <b>Australia</b> 1 Travis Head, 2 David Warner, 3 Mitchell Marsh, 4 Steven Smith, 5 Marnus Labuschagne, 6 Josh Inglis (wk), 7 Glenn Maxwell, 8 Pat Cummins (capt), 9 Mitchell Starc, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood <b>South Africa</b>  1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Temba Bavuma (capt), 3 Rassie van der Dussen, 4 Aiden Markram, 5 Heinrich Klaasen, 6 David Miller, 7 Marco Jansen, 8 Keshav Maharaj, 9 Gerald Coetzee, 10 Kagiso Rabada, 11 Tabraiz Shamsi Marco Jansen is back at No. 7 and they've gone with two spinners. Feels the right balance of side. <b>1.30pm</b> Arindam: "Is anyone talking about the C-word today" - there will be a lot of talk of cricket, yes. <b>1.25pm</b> Tapos: "Usually if there is possibility of rain, teams want to bat 2nd. But, given the record of SA in second innings recently, both teams would like to bat first. Interesting dilemma." - Indeed it is Chuvi: "Despite the threat of rains, the captain winning the toss should bat 1st. When a Reserve day is available, always factor it over DLS . Spin friendly pitch demands 1st batting" - Thing is, they will reduce the game today before activating the reserve day. Adds to all the possible scenarios. Temba Bavuma is emerging in his kit for the toss <b>1.20pm</b> Ten minutes until the toss and signs are it will be on time. Warm-ups in full swing. South Africa are having a huddle. "Bavuma now getting some treatment from the physio," adds Firdose. "Looks like they are stretching that right hammie. Temba now leaving the field with the team manager, presumably to get his kit for the toss. Markram still out there. So I'd say that's a clear sign Temba is playing." Sowmya: "Australia have to include Smudge in their 11 for sure. He has been exceptional under pressure for Australia. Would be tempted to bench stoinis. Australia can't afford both Stoinis and Marsh feeding the powerful SA batters with dibbly dobblers." - Smith was never going anywhere <b>1.10pm</b> <b>Covers are now coming off</b>. If in doubt over the next little while, the covers will either be in some state of being off or on, until they are either completely off or completely on and the game is either on or off. Steve: "Schroedinger covers: Till the game starts, the covers can be both off and on simultaneously" Sarthak: "Do we have a special look on what's happening on the ground vis a vis Marnus vs Marcus? Is Marnus on with his keeping gloves? Has Stoinis picked up left arm spin yet?" Marnus is giving throwdowns to Smith. And not that there was any doubt, but Starc is marking his run-up. No sign of Stoinis as yet. "Marnus getting throwdowns, but not a lot of intensity in the act," adds Fidel <b>1.03pm</b> <strong>The pitch is being covered</strong>, reports Firdose, although no rain yet. Perhaps very light drizzle, updates Fidel. Tag-team rain updates. It's a thing. (Fidel is an expert from the Asia Cup) Vinod Rajpal: "World Cup in Asia Cup mode...... weather discussion is going ON!" I did feel left out during the Asia Cup. Although the WhatsApp group was fun to wake up to in the morning JC: "In rugby, the teams are known almost 5 days before the match. Why dont we know the SA team sooner? In fact .. I'm struggling to get a teamsheet!" They don't have to be declared until the toss. Adds to the suspense! Another of the key performers for Australia has been Adam Zampa who has rebounded magnificently after a difficult start to the tournament. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-adam-zampa-the-self-aware-non-alpha-on-top-of-his-game-1408801">Fidel wrote about him</a>. Kannadachi : "Today can never be the retribution for 1999, 2007 for the simple reason that the respective ODI teams of Australia and SA would have gone through at least 8 overhauls!!!" Stop letting little details get in the way of easy narratives (but, yes, it's a very valid point) <b>12.57pm</b> Temba watch - here's Firdose: "Temba is walking out with his bat, gloves etc...in fact he is having a jog on this own up and down the field. The lights are also coming on." - Good day to bowl? Firdose reckons Bavuma is looking like someone who will play Krypto: "As a South African I don't like this situation at all , it evokes PTSD. Furthermore we all aware we should bat first however with Rain and DLS that makes it a conundrum that just adds to the anxiety . Ill be watching this like a good horror movie with my hands covering my face peaking between my fingers." <b>12.55pm</b> The most stunning feat of this World Cup (please don't @ me about Virat's 50 centuries, which are, of course, a magnificent achievement) has come from Glenn Maxwell with his double century against Afghanistan. Raunak Kapoor talked to Aaron Finch about Maxwell's amazing skill and how he does it. Lee: "I want to believe in South Africa, so badly, but it's so hard as we've been hurt so many times. My heart is with SA as a South African but my head tells me AUS. Prove my heart right Proteas!!!!" Mathew: "We haven't yet seen Warner, Head, Maxwell and Marsh all fire in the same innings. Hopefully they get the chance to do so today!" <b>12.50pm</b> Sandeep: "Is there reserve day in case match not possible today? If not, how finalist will be decided?" Okay folks. I'm going to say this nicely. Yes there's a reserve day. If there is not a completed match South Africa go through. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-world-cup-2023-semi-final-south-africa-vs-australia-kolkata-weather-forecast-reserve-day-info-1408720">All the details here</a>. A bit more info from Firdose: Australia are out there looking at the pitch. Don't believe this one has been changed. Adam: "Quinton de Kock is going to be vital for South Africa today...he can single-handedly put so much pressure on opposition and if it ends up being a shortened match his strike rate could shift the equation a lot." <b>12.45pm</b> Aaron Finch knows all about being World Cup knockout matches. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricket-videos/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-aaron-finch-on-australia-champion-mentality-in-knockout-games-1408773">Here's his thoughts on Australia's strengths</a>.

KKR hammer tournament favourites SRH to lift the IPL trophy for the third time; and while West Indies hosting South Africa in a dead-rubber T20I is nowhere near the glitz and glamour of even the yet-to-begin presentation ceremony of the IPL final, there is still the T20 World Cup to build-up for. Welcome to Kingston for the third and final T20I of the series, before both sides are boosted by the power of the IPL returnees ahead of the big tournament.
