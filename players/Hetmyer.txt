England turn to Liam Livingstone... nope, scratch that. Will Jacks will bowl instead. Maybe because the left-hander is on strike (although Livingstone can bowl offies too)?

looped up outside off, little bit of grip and spin. Cut off the back foot to cover

Box of balls being brought out here, presumably because of the boundaries and dew? Anyway, Rashid to continue

Good length, bit of dip, bit of turn too - Hetmyer presses forward and gets a thick inside edge which balloons into where short leg would have been if this were that type of game
