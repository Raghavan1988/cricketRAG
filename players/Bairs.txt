But it turns in sharply and hits Bairstow's pads while he is on the back foot. Bairstow too late to bring the bat down and it appears he's been hit in front of off stump. Bairstow is not even waiting for ball-tracking, he begins walking back after seeing where it hit his pads, and the replay confirms that's crashing into middle. A duck

<B>now he's on the move!</B> Seizes on Scholtz's turn to blink, he tossed it up a fraction fuller, maybe anticipating another reverse. Instead he opened his stance deep in the crease and pummelled a launch over long-on!
