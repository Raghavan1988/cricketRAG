Their net run rate has jumped into the positive, up to 3.08 - crucially already above Scotland's, with Namibia still to come. Win that one and they'll be back on track for the Super 8s (unless, of course, Scotland can roll Australia) <b>Adil Rashid </b>is Player of the Match after his 4 for 11: "I thought we bowled exceptionally well, nice to bowl them out for 47. Always nice when you see your first one spin. When you get a wicket first ball it sets the tone. Some pitches are flatter, I try to adjust in the first over. It was spinning quite a bit, going wider with the wrong'un, sliders, set them up that way. Very happy today. One game at a time, we've got Namibia next, our job is to go out there and do our thing."
