Shadab Khan run out (McCarthy) 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 4m) SR: 0
Ah, beautiful footwork from McCarthy runs Shadab out, that's amazing soccer skills! Bowls a pinpoint accurate yorker and he digs it out down the pitch, just heads down the deck aimlessly and Shadab is short of his crease. Incredible awareness from McCarthy who just kept sprinting after his follow-through and nudged the ball towards the stumps, fielding has been top-notch! Pakistan have lost wickets in a cluster!

Hammered in short at middle and leg, not quite out of the sweet spot and that hung in the air for quite a while, McCarthy almost pocketed a stunner at deep backward square, gamely jumped one-handed, got his hand on it but just couldn't keep his balance with the momentum taking him over the rope, superb effort nevertheless, saved a six with that flick before tumbling over. Exceptional!

They're doing this at a canter, tables have turned quickly, Ireland seems deflated. Fuller on middle, he says thank you very much and knocks it down for a four

Around the wicket, slower fuller length delivery angling in from outside off, rifled down to long-on
Ahad: "Why do we keep discussing and questioning the 2 most successful T20I batters over the last 3-4 years and no one seems to be talking about our hyped-up bowling attack with so many big names who have conceded over 170 twice against a Kiwi B-team and now again seem toothless against the Irish?"

<strong>Hammered! </strong> Vintage Fakhar batters it with a lot of oomph over deep backward square and I think it has gone out of the park, balls change please! Not learning and bowling in his arc at middle, wrong line and Fakhar is well set.Pakistan on the ascendancy here. That's Fakhar's favorite shot

<strong>Smoked it! </strong>Around the wicket again, clearly this angle is not perturbing Zaman at all. Short and zinging back into the southpaw, gets in a wonderful position and thumps it over deep midwicket again. This is all too easy for Zaman.

Sublime shot! Once again shortish and in his hitting arc at middle, stands tall, gets under it and whiplashes it over deep square who jumped one-handed but couldn't get hand on it

Fizzes through on middle and leg, came around the wicket and hit the deck hard, Zaman wanted to slug that out of the park but got beaten by the pace

Zaman is OUT! caught
c Delany b White
Fakhar Zaman c Delany b White 78 (40b 6x4 6x6 61m) SR: 195
<strong>What a snare!</strong> Is there a twist in the tale? Fakhar Zaman went down on one knee and unleashes a muscular swing but doesn't clear deep midwicket, Delany charged in from the rope and dived superbly to pocket the catch low, it was a shorter delivery and there to be hit, couldn't get under it fully and has to go. Azam Khan coming in next

Flighted on middle but the length is quite short, he yanks his front-foot out of the way and takes the aerial route again, all the way for six to cause delirium in the stands, way over deep midwicket,

<strong>Carved </strong>over extra cover with grace and poise, puts the bowler under pressure by hitting him for a four on the first ball. It was a half-tracker wide of off, cross-bats it away into the gap
