We have thoroughly enjoyed your company. Hope to see you all during the first test of the 2 match test series on 22nd March. Until then, take care. Signing off on behalf of Binoy, Raghav, Madushka and myself, Rashad. Zeeshan: "Here comes Rashad in the commentary box and Rishad weaved the magic. " <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto is the Player of the Series:</strong> "All praise to the Almighty. The way Tamim started his innings, really happy for him but he should have finished the innings. The way Mushi batted helped Rishad's innings. I think on a wicket like this the bowlers showed a lot of character, especially with the new ball our 3 fast bowlers bowled really well. In the middle overs Miraz and Rishad bowled really well. I am very happy with the bowlers. This win was very important for us, now Test Championship is coming up and we have already won one match against New Zealand before, so this series is definitely important for us." <strong>Rishad Hossain is the Player of the Match:</strong> "I was very happy to finish and win the match. At first I was a bit nervous then later on I started to connect the ball really well with the bat. Mushfiq told me to hit the ball hard if it is in my zone. All praise to the Almighty and please pray for me." <strong>Kusal Mendis:</strong> "I think we were 40-50 runs short. The bowling unit bowled pretty well and the fielders had a very good game. Janith batted really well after we lost couple of wickets in the middle order. I'm very happy with his performance and the bowlers had a very good game. Lahiru Kumara bowled really well in the first ten overs then in the end also, he is coming in form." Presentation ceremony Leading the way was the young Tanzid Tamim, who replaced Soumya Sarkar as the concussion substitute and scored an incredible 84 runs (81)--the most runs ever scored by a concussed substitute since Marnus Labuschange (80). Although Lahiru Kumara bowled brilliantly and recorded his first four-for in an ODI, he did not have the requisite backing from his teammates. Bangladesh lost wickets quickly in the middle of the innings, but they were able to win in the end as a result of a strong performance by veteran Mushfiqur and another youngster, Rishad 48 (18). When Rishad entered the crease, he completely turned the tide in favour of Bangladesh by hitting five fours and four sixes. <strong>Bangladesh won the match by 4 wickets and secured the 3 match series by 2-1</strong>
