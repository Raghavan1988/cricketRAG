He does try to get the boundary but plinks it to mid-off's left. They hare for a single. Was pitched right up at pace, he cleared the front leg and tried to go downtown, but the bat face opened on impact

Over:19
Shot: SLOG_SHOT
run scored: 2
Mistimes the pull but gets two to that midwicket pocket again. The bat has been busted, Jaker - to check if the bat was broken - whacked it face-first onto the knee and it was broken proper.

OUT! {"short": "caught", "long": "c Markram b Maharaj", "commentary": "Jaker Ali c Markram b Maharaj 8 (9b 0x4 0x6 11m) SR: 88.88"}
<strong>The rising cheer doesn't hit crescendo as Jaker elevates the full ball but can't clear long-on.</strong> He got close to the pitch but the impact was from too far low and Markram took a bread-basket catch

Shot: SLOG_SHOT
run scored: 2
Low full toss is thrashed downtown, the slow outfield gives an extra second for the fielder and the batters but the second isn't on. <strong>Maharaj can't collect the throw on the bounce and Mahmudullah, who was falling short, made it</strong>
