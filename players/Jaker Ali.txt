Mid-on and mid-off won't go back for the last two balls. Will Jaker see this as a free hit?

He does try to get the boundary but plinks it to mid-off's left. They hare for a single. Was pitched right up at pace, he cleared the front leg and tried to go downtown, but the bat face opened on impact

Jaker Ali b Lamichhane 12 (26b 0x4 0x6) SR: 46.15
<strong>knocks him over with the wrong'un now! 100 T20I wickets for Lamichhane, and Bangladesh sink further!</strong> Googly on a back of a length on off. Jaker, like the previous ball, does not pick it and tries to play it off the pitch. The ball, though, whizzes off the surface and spins back in, cutting Jaker in half. Pin-balls off his thigh pad into the stumps, and Nepal are just two wickets away from bowling Bangladesh out!

there's Hasaranga's googly, and <strong>it's immediately yielded a lbw wicket.</strong>. Or has it? The batter has reviewed. Has he edged this? That's the only thing that will save him, I suspect.
