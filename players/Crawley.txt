<strong>12.13pm</strong> Bumrah it is to begin the session. Still a new ball in his hand. Just six overs old. Two slips and a gully <strong>12.10pm</strong> Jasprit Bumrah is bowling on the side pitches to warm himself up. <strong>12.05pm</strong> Welcome back. England will be absolutely buzzing after that session. It might sound harsh to say of someone who scored 209 but he showed ordinary game awareness when he charged James Anderson with seven men on the fence. He should have just taken a single that fifth ball of the over just like he had done in the previous over. England have accepted that gift, and have started superbly. Ben Duckett looks dangerous, and two big sessions are coming up for India's senior bowlers. The fortress is vulnerable. England need to keep the foot on. How do India respond? How do they control the flow of the runs?

<strong>12.13pm</strong> Bumrah it is to begin the session. Still a new ball in his hand. Just six overs old. Two slips and a gully <strong>12.10pm</strong> Jasprit Bumrah is bowling on the side pitches to warm himself up. <strong>12.05pm</strong> Welcome back. England will be absolutely buzzing after that session. It might sound harsh to say of someone who scored 209 but he showed ordinary game awareness when he charged James Anderson with seven men on the fence. He should have just taken a single that fifth ball of the over just like he had done in the previous over. England have accepted that gift, and have started superbly. Ben Duckett looks dangerous, and two big sessions are coming up for India's senior bowlers. The fortress is vulnerable. England need to keep the foot on. How do India respond? How do they control the flow of the runs?

Only two slips and a gully. Mohammed Siraj charges in. <strong>9.28am</strong> Out come Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley. India's huddle is done. We are all ready. "Sid, why did you leave your familiar haunt of the live blog page? Who's subbing for you there?" Dev, I just follow orders. But Val Baynes has you covered <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-india-2023-24-1389386/india-vs-england-4th-test-1389402/live-match-blog-1">over at the Live Report</a>. <strong>9.25am</strong> Sampath Bandarupalli puts number to what we have been saying: this Indian team is in transition. The previous instance of India handing Test debuts to four or more players in the same series was during the 2020-21 Australia tour. If you remember, that tour featured a freakish number of injuries. Before that, it was against South Africa in the 2000 home series. How does he know? He just used <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;debut_or_last=1;filter=advanced;groupby=series;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;qualmin1=4;qualval1=player_count;team=6;template=results;tournament_type=2;tournament_type=3;type=allround">Statsguru</a>. <strong>9.20am</strong> So Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett will start the fascinating contest against India's spinner in earnest. So far on the tour, they have provided England a good start five times out of six. Only one time have England lost a wicket before reaching 40. But in that second innings in Rajkot, India showed they kinda had a read on the openers. One of the obvious changes was Kuldeep Yadav bowling it wide for Duckett and taking it further away? Let's see how they react to this new challenge. S Kishore: "Huge opportunity for Akash Deep to showcase his skills in the absence of Bumrah. India long looking for fourth proper seamer after the likes of Bumrah, Shami,Siraj." <strong>9.10am</strong> Official communication from England on Rehan Ahmed: "Rehan Ahmed will return home for personal reasons with immediate effect from England Men's Test tour of India. He will not be returning to India. England will not be replacing Ahmed for the rest of the tour." <strong>9am</strong> England have won their second toss of the series. <strong>Ben Stokes says they will have a bat.</strong> "The first hour will give us an indication what it will do in the longer term."

Only two slips and a gully. Mohammed Siraj charges in. <strong>9.28am</strong> Out come Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley. India's huddle is done. We are all ready. "Sid, why did you leave your familiar haunt of the live blog page? Who's subbing for you there?" Dev, I just follow orders. But Val Baynes has you covered <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-india-2023-24-1389386/india-vs-england-4th-test-1389402/live-match-blog-1">over at the Live Report</a>. <strong>9.25am</strong> Sampath Bandarupalli puts number to what we have been saying: this Indian team is in transition. The previous instance of India handing Test debuts to four or more players in the same series was during the 2020-21 Australia tour. If you remember, that tour featured a freakish number of injuries. Before that, it was against South Africa in the 2000 home series. How does he know? He just used <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;debut_or_last=1;filter=advanced;groupby=series;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;qualmin1=4;qualval1=player_count;team=6;template=results;tournament_type=2;tournament_type=3;type=allround">Statsguru</a>. <strong>9.20am</strong> So Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett will start the fascinating contest against India's spinner in earnest. So far on the tour, they have provided England a good start five times out of six. Only one time have England lost a wicket before reaching 40. But in that second innings in Rajkot, India showed they kinda had a read on the openers. One of the obvious changes was Kuldeep Yadav bowling it wide for Duckett and taking it further away? Let's see how they react to this new challenge. S Kishore: "Huge opportunity for Akash Deep to showcase his skills in the absence of Bumrah. India long looking for fourth proper seamer after the likes of Bumrah, Shami,Siraj." <strong>9.10am</strong> Official communication from England on Rehan Ahmed: "Rehan Ahmed will return home for personal reasons with immediate effect from England Men's Test tour of India. He will not be returning to India. England will not be replacing Ahmed for the rest of the tour." <strong>9am</strong> England have won their second toss of the series. <strong>Ben Stokes says they will have a bat.</strong> "The first hour will give us an indication what it will do in the longer term." He says his bowling is coming back slightly ahead of schedule, but still work to be put in. <strong>Rehan Ahmed has left the tour for personal reasons.</strong> Rohit Sharma says the surface looks dry, has cracks, but "we just have to play well to win". He is impressed with the character shown by the youngsters.

<strong>9.30am</strong> A lot of jumpers around. Both Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett in sleeveless ones. Japsrit Bumrah in a short-sleeved shirt is ready to bowl. Three slips and a gully Vignesh : "Baz still loos fit though, so it will be a great to have Baz back in log off/on to catch those blinders." <strong>9.28am</strong> Ashwin walks to a guard of honour. Knowing the Ashwin family a little bit, I think there are a few tears being held back. His dad and mum will be watching with pride too. Hugs all around. A particularly special one from his spin partner, Ravindra Jadeja. Two guys who are so good both with the ball and bat that it should be illegal. <strong>9.15am</strong> Time for cap presentation for Ashwin. Rahul Dravid to hand it over. Ashwin's wife and his daughters are there. Ashwin has handed over the cap to his daughters. His family is beaming. His parents would have loved to have been there, I am sure, but his mum is unwell. Not unwell enough to keep him from playing, though. We can't hear Dravid's or Ashwin's speeches. Ralph: "Collingwood was such an ace fielder that he can probably still do a great job as substitute at age 47.  Not so sure about Marcus, though!" <strong>England have won the toss, and will bat first</strong>. The sun is just coming out. India, es expected, have picked three spinners. That means only two changes: Jasprit Bumrah comes back for Akash Deep, and Devdutt Padikall debuts in place of Rajat Patidar, who injured himself during training last evening. So Patidar hasn't been dropped. An update from BCCI: "Rajat Patidar got hit on his left ankle during practice session on 6th March, 2024. He pulled up sore on the morning of the game and was not available for selection." <strong>England</strong> Z Crawley, BM Duckett, OJ Pope, JE Root, JM Bairstow, BA Stokes*, BT Foakes†, TW Hartley, MA Wood, Shoaib Bashir, JM Anderson <strong>India team</strong>	YBK Jaiswal, RG Sharma*, Shubman Gill, D Padikkal, RA Jadeja, SN Khan, DC Jurel†, R Ashwin, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, JJ Bumrah <strong>8.58am</strong> Nick Knight says the pitch is a belter. Good for batting. He says there is no point playing three seamers here. Two minutes to the toss. Breaking news: Devdutt Padikkal has been handed over a cap. So Rajat Patidar makes way for him. Ashwin hands over the cap to him. Five debutants for India in this series. Only the second time this has happened not counting their first series ever. <strong>8.55am</strong> Just looking at the warm-ups, I dare say India might play Kuldeep Yadav ahead of Akash Deep. Kuldeep is bowling on a side pitch but Akash is in a hoodie and just standing nearby. Five minutes to go to the toss. "Why Collingwood and Trescothick? Why not other players who are not playing this test but selected in squad??" EarlyQuestions, England are reduced to 13. Leach is out, Robinson is at the hotel. So if a third substitute is required, it might well be Collingwood. <strong>8.50am</strong> In this Test we add two to just the 76 players who have played 100 Tests. And Jonny Bairstow has had a special presentation made already by the England team. Vish Ehantharajah with live scenes: "Bairstow's 100th cap presentation out on the field. Root did the chat, his mother (Janet), sister (Becky), partner (Megan) and son next to him." Also Ben Foakes has been presented a special cap for his 25th Test. By Ollie Pope. Prakash: "Hope the situation doesn't arise where Collingwood have to come in!! He can pluck anything from the air within 2 meter radius!!" <strong>8.40am</strong> As has been the trend, India haven't yet decided on their XI. They usually make that final call on the final one or two spots looking at the weather and the pitch in the morning. Speaking of weather, Karthik Krishnaswamy is enjoying it in Dharamsala with the mountains displaying fresh snow. Here is his <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ind-vs-england-5th-test-india-dharamsala-dilemma-three-quicks-or-three-spinners-1423663">report from the ground</a>, which ends up asking the question: three seamers or three spinners? "How can paul collingwood and Marcus trescothick play as substitutes. They are retired long ago??" Somya, any member of the touring party can come on as a substitute fielder as long as the match officials allow it. <strong>8.30am</strong> It's 8 degrees up in the hills. I don't know which forecast to trust but my app says we might wing any rain or snow as has been predicted on some websites. Not a lot of sun expected today, though. Welcome to the live coverage of the final Test of what has been an entertaining series. From Dharamsala, or because England are playing in close to home-like weather, shall we call it Durhamsala? India lead the series 3-1, but they still have a proud record to defend. They have never lost more than one Test in a series in close to 12 years. England have managed to compete with just four bowlers somehow, but still they will know 3-2 is way more respectable than 4-1. And, of course, World Test Championship points are up for grabs still. Let's hope we get a full Test. Early teams news. England named an XI yesterday, which included two spinners, one of whom, Shoaib Bashir, was unwell. He has been cleared fit, and has made it to the ground. Ollie Robinson is not there. Paul Collingwood or Marcus Trescothick might be called on for substitution duties shopuld such a need arise.

India have lost out on a wicket. It is Jurel who says no to Rohit
