<strong>two in two for Rashid, and NZ are falling like a pack of cards!</strong> Back of a length on middle and off. Does not spin back in and goes on with the arm. Might have either been a googly or a slider. Bracewell, because he has not read it off the hand, stays back. Cannot bring his bat down in time and gets pinned on the back leg. The finger goes up but Bracewell wants to have another look. More in hope than anticipation, you'd reckon. <b>No bat involved, and Ball Tracking returns with three reds. NZ, well, nothing is going right for them!</b>

<strong>Powered down the ground for a 6!</strong> Makes full use of the freebie. He bowled it quicker on a length from around with little bit of turn, he was right behind the line and clubs it high and handsome over long-off

Clobbers this straight to Babar at short mid-off and he drops it, looks in discomfort, was speared quicker just outside off, he wanted to slug that away to covers but Babar got in the way, barely had any time to react

<strong>And gone!</strong> Drops it a little short on middle, tries to lift it up and over midwicket but can only drag it to Babar Azam at short midwicket. Another prized scalp, spinners making a big impact in this game for Pakistan as New Zealand find themselves in a pickle; they need a partnership
