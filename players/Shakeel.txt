"Suddenly this match became more interesting than Ind vs Pak." What do you mean "suddenly", Dr Veneela? <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/india-vs-pakistan-19th-match-group-a-1415719/live-cricket-score>Oh, I see...</a>

full and bunted down the ground, they'll come back for two. <b>Oman raise 150 from the final ball</b>, but Scotland will be pretty happy with their work
<b>2.32pm:</b> Oman wanted to put up a big score, and they've at least given themselves something to bowl at. It certainly won't daunt Scotland, though, after they reeled in a stiffer target against Namibia a few nights ago. Victory here would put them back on top of Group B, and significantly increase the jeopardy for defending champions England. Miller will be back for the chase shortly Here's Mark Watt: "About changing up line and length, different paces and trying not to get hit to the short side. We were happy with 150 on that wicket. [Dead ball wicket] It's a bit sneaky, the batter is looking up ready to face, so I bowl it. In my eyes I thought it was a fair delivery, People know it's in my armoury. [Chase?] Target the powerplay, take it deep and make the most of the short boundary with the wind." Meanwhile, over on Long Island, <a href=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166/india-vs-pakistan-19th-match-group-a-1415719/live-cricket-score>it's all going eerily well for Pakistan</a>... They couldn't stuff it up, could they?
