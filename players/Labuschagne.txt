<strong>1pm:</strong> Thank you, Alex. Just minutes away from a restart after lunch. Australia have looked solid so far and Pakistan's bowling attack is not as potent as a unit without the services of Shaheen Afridi. Pakistan need to win this session to swing the momentum in their favor; nothing comes easy in Test cricket, so they will have to strive and build pressure. Sajid Khan was dominated and runs started to flow easily in the second half of morning session. It will be interesting to see how he fares in the remaining day. Perhaps a fierce burst from Aamer Jamal and some control from Mir Hamza could be a good bowling partnership to start with <strong>12.31pm Lunch</strong> Australia go to lunch at 78 for 1. A good session of cricket. Pakistan built some pressure for periods and should have had Warner caught at slip. Saim Ayub was in at first slip for one over while Salman was off the field and dropped a sitter. It didn't cost too much as Salman picked up Warner for the second time in two Tests. He looked very threatening and was probably under bowled by Shan Masood as Khawaja played Sajid pretty comfortably. The second session should be interesting. Rvel will be back after lunch. Andrew: "Australia will not be penalised for slow over rates, the rule is if you bowl a team out in under 80 overs no penalty. As Pakistan did not achieve this they were penalised.The rule was changed for 2023.In reality slow over rates should only be penalised if a result is not achieved, if a match is finished in 4 days there should be no penalties. ICC have this so wrong. " My apologies, Andrew is right but it's a quirk in the rules given Australia failed to bowl 80 in the allotted time let alone 90. GCW: "Just managed to check yesterday's scorecard. Have the batsmen been listed in reverse order, and Hamza carried his bat?"

Rohan: "At what point do the ICC step in and penalise Cummins on his slow over rates ? In a 2 hour session so far this series, Australia has only gone around 25 overs per session yet Pakistan were docked 2 points in the first test for slow over rates." They should be penalised for yesterday. It will be announced post-match if they are.

ak: "Can one explain the high over rate by the number of dots bowled? Even when spinners bowl the majority of the overs, we rarely get 30 overs." A lot of off spin helped and a low run-rate. 29 overs is still short of the minimum target so it's an odd thing to celebrate

<strong>1pm:</strong> Thank you, Alex. Just minutes away from a restart after lunch. Australia have looked solid so far and Pakistan's bowling attack is not as potent as a unit without the services of Shaheen Afridi. Pakistan need to win this session to swing the momentum in their favor; nothing comes easy in Test cricket, so they will have to strive and build pressure. Sajid Khan was dominated and runs started to flow easily in the second half of morning session. It will be interesting to see how he fares in the remaining day. Perhaps a fierce burst from Aamer Jamal and some control from Mir Hamza could be a good bowling partnership to start with <strong>12.31pm Lunch</strong> Australia go to lunch at 78 for 1. A good session of cricket. Pakistan built some pressure for periods and should have had Warner caught at slip. Saim Ayub was in at first slip for one over while Salman was off the field and dropped a sitter. It didn't cost too much as Salman picked up Warner for the second time in two Tests. He looked very threatening and was probably under bowled by Shan Masood as Khawaja played Sajid pretty comfortably. The second session should be interesting. Rvel will be back after lunch. Andrew: "Australia will not be penalised for slow over rates, the rule is if you bowl a team out in under 80 overs no penalty. As Pakistan did not achieve this they were penalised.The rule was changed for 2023.In reality slow over rates should only be penalised if a result is not achieved, if a match is finished in 4 days there should be no penalties. ICC have this so wrong. " My apologies, Andrew is right but it's a quirk in the rules given Australia failed to bowl 80 in the allotted time let alone 90. GCW: "Just managed to check yesterday's scorecard. Have the batsmen been listed in reverse order, and Hamza carried his bat?"

Rohan: "At what point do the ICC step in and penalise Cummins on his slow over rates ? In a 2 hour session so far this series, Australia has only gone around 25 overs per session yet Pakistan were docked 2 points in the first test for slow over rates." They should be penalised for yesterday. It will be announced post-match if they are.

ak: "Can one explain the high over rate by the number of dots bowled? Even when spinners bowl the majority of the overs, we rarely get 30 overs." A lot of off spin helped and a low run-rate. 29 overs is still short of the minimum target so it's an odd thing to celebrate

In theory, yes, provided there are no docked points for over rates.

In his scathing rejoinder, Michael Vaughan opposed the decision to go off the field, as he believed the light wasn't dangerous enough to halt play. The idea of using the pink ball was also floated to keep the show running. Let's hope stakeholders at the ICC will address this perennial debate. In the post-match presser, Usman Khawaja vehemently opposed the idea of using the pink ball in Tests, stating, 'The red ball is Test cricket.' He added that if the pink ball is used, then he's retiring, emphasizing the impact of a change in balls Essar Banday: "Who says Test cricket is dull? I am waiting for the game to get started. In India, it's 4 am and I can't wait for the action to resume. Aamer Jamal" I think it's just a conversation topic with no real substance. Test cricket is very much alive and a supremely entertaining format, especially on lively sporting pitches <strong>Andrew McGlashan from SCG: </strong> Morning from the SCG. First thing to say is that it's dry and fine at the moment. There was the occasional light morning shower and there are a few more lingering around the coast. The pitch is uncovered and the players warming up. So fingers crossed we get a clear day. It's also the annual pink day for the Jane McGrath foundation. The SCG really gets behind this great cause Neal: "Third day is moving day and Pakistan need to bowl Australia out before stumps to have any chance to gain control." Waz: "@Gonez the reason being playing/bowling for 8 hours is already a large physical task, stretching that out by an hour or two would be unfair on the bowlers" "Yes, that will increase a day's workload <strong>9.34am</strong> Salman Ali Agha couldn't have mistimed his toilet break any worse. He went away for an over, and Saim Ayub was stationed at first slip, where he dropped an absolute dolly, giving another life to David Warner. However, Warner didn't make full use of that reprieve. Here's more on Pakistan's first slip woes <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/not-again-saim-ayub-adds-to-pakistan-s-first-slip-woes-1415453">Not again! Saim Ayub adds to Pakistan's first slip woes</a> "For a long period of time, he was in people's faces and doing stuff; but that wasn't always Davey," Khawaja said. "He was getting told to play a certain way by the coaching staff and people around at certain points. He's such a team player. If you ask him to do something, he'll do it. That's the frustrating part when people come at him because I know he'll do anything he needs to for the team to win a game." <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/usman-khawaja-on-david-warner-reputation-he-was-told-to-play-certain-way-1415490">'He was told to play a certain way' - Khawaja on Warner's feisty reputation</a> by Andrew McGlashan "Perhaps the scorecard doesn't quite do justice to the opportunity Pakistan have here at the SCG in this final Test. Of the 47 fairly routine overs that were sent down on a grey second day in Sydney, there was one ball that provided Pakistan a faint glimpse into what a good third day might look like. And all things good that come through here run through the man who bowled it" More from Danyal Rasool's Day 2 Analysis: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/spin-friendly-scg-pitch-keeps-agha-salman-and-pakistan-hopeful-against-australia-1415491">Spin-friendly SCG pitch keeps Salman, and Pakistan, hopeful</a> Gomez: "We lost 4-5 hours yesterday, why only start 30 minutes early today? why not start 1 hour early? And why must we stop at 6pm, when it i still daylight (in most cities in Australia)" Those are some brilliant questions <strong>9.20am</strong>: Hello, everyone. It's good to be back for what promises to be a fantastic day. Rvel Zahid and Alex Malcolm with you again to bring you all the action. Both teams are set to jostle for ascendancy after rain played spoilsport on Day two. Pakistan will search for early wickets and aim to bowl Australia out with some lead to go into the second innings. Let's see who will win the crucial morning session. Play starts half an hour early to make up for lost time due to bad light and rain. Marnus Labuschagne looked solid yesterday, but he'll have to restart his innings and get into the flow again. Meanwhile, Aamer Jamal was in the middle of a hostile spell and considering the kind of memorable series he's had, we can expect more fireworks from him. The spin duo of Salman Ali Agha and Sajid Khan created pressure and got assistance from the track, which has started to wear and tear. Most importantly, it's pleasing to see bright sunshine and clear skies welcoming us, much to the delight of players and fans alike We'll have a 30-minute early start tomorrow. Make sure to join us; we will have plenty of action for you, and the skies are expected to be clear as well. The game moved along nicely and Pakistan came back after a solid opening stand between Usman Khawaja and David Warner. Mir Hamza was relentless and accurate, and so was Aamer Jamal - buoyed after his spirited 82-run knock. Salman Ali Agha extracted plenty of turn and has become better as this series progressed; he got the prized wicket of Warner. Pakistan maintained good pressure and reaped the rewards for it. They will come with fresh legs in the morning session tomorrow and try to bowl the hosts out with some lead but Australia have a long batting lineup and they will look to stitch up some handy partnerships to erase the deficit. It should be a fascinating day of play. For now, it's goodbye and goodnight from Alex Malcolm and Rvel Zahid. We look forward to your company tomorrow! See you then! <strong> 4.52pm Stumps on day two. Play has been officially called off for the day</strong> Speaking of the state of Test cricket globally, the team on Around The Wicket, ESPN's new TV show, discussed the issues on the most recent episode Nauman: "Actually these breaks are good for Pak bowlers, keep them fresh. And Marnus who was settled has to start again. A little bit of moisture that may have snuck into the pitch may also assist them for a couple of overs after resumption." Ferdous : "People is comparing football with cricket which I dislike most. Cricket is at his place and football is another subject. There are lot of cricket fan like me who enjoys all format of cricket. So I don't see any devaluation of test cricket " The umpires are lurking on the outfield with umbrellas pointing up, which is not a good sign. They are having a serious chat out there or maybe just planning a dinner because it's still drizzling and the covers are drenched in rain so there's a fleeting prospect of any play Hamza: "Football is more aggressive field game than cricket and doesnt halt in rain. We are in advance tech era, should be some solution regarding rain so beautiful moments of game are not haltes/destroyed by it." Well we could have more stadiums with retractable roofs The way Pakistan plays and how a wicket often spurs them into action, it looks like they have been more affected by the rain. Aamer Jamal just got Usman Khawaja, and Pakistan had an opening to pick a few more in a cluster. So, it was in Pakistan's interest to carry on with that momentum in overcast conducive conditions Jason: "I am not sure the constant mention of Mitch Marsh's career Shield average as a way to devalue Shield statistics is valid.  Marsh had a horror start to his career but has averaged above 40 in Shield cricket since start of 2017/18 season with an unbeaten century in his only innings last season." Rain was not an issue for me to play cricket; in fact, it gave me an extra reason to play during the monsoon season in Lahore, mostly on my rooftop. Yes, there were occasional slips and challenging conditions, but we braved them Zain Ali: "Just waking up, how many catches did Pakistan drop? How difficult were they? And who were the culprits?" Saim Ayub at first slip dropped Warner in the 14th over. It was an absolute sitter Nicko: "I want Green to succeed, but he is beyond the (somewhat hyped) promising stage now with 24 tests. He averages 33.59 in tests (lower than his bowling average), far below his FC average. I suspect the problem is confidence and surety not technique. Being nervy starting doesn't augur well for opening. Or is it just spin where that is a problem? Or not at all?" <strong>4.24pm: </strong> Doesn't look like it will get dramatically better anytime soon, but I'm keeping an eye on the sky and will keep you updated if the heavens spring a surprise Scott Boland has been released from the Australian squad to return to the Melbourne Stars. He will return to Melbourne tomorrow for the match against the Sydney Sixers at the MCG on Saturday Mal: "Much as I'd love to see Green back in the side, I think I would pick Bancroft. Warner's counter-attacking batting stye and fast scoring rate helps push opposition bowling attacks onto the defensive, but we really don't have a similar replacement. Building a solid platform can help Head and Marsh at 5 and 6 tee off to push the scoring rate back up. Meanwhile I'd see what I could do to groom Green or a Shield player to become more of an aggressive opener, to replace Khawaja in time." Not much is happening yet--just steady rain. The forecast looks good for the next three days and given that we've had two four-day Tests, there is plenty of time left to have a result in this game Taimoor Hassan : "Why not simply slot Josh Inglis at the top, replace Carey, and include Green at number 7? This way, you'll have a few overs from Green, and he'll also get the much-needed rest. More bowling options mean greater variety. It's rare to see any team with five genuine 135-plus pacers in the playing eleven. Additionally, on a square-turning pitch, Hazelwood can be omitted for an extra spinner, still leaving four fast options. " Nauman: "Mitch Marsh finally fulfilling the expectations in his 30s gives me hopes that Faheem Ashraf might be world class in 3-4 years time." <strong>4.06pm</strong> The match is beautifully poised and it's such a shame that we lost too many overs due to this prolonged rain interruption. There's no activity on the ground and the squares are still under cover <strong>4pm</strong> Still raining. Rvel to step into commentary. <strong>3.45pm</strong> Lyndon: "I really don't know why there is so much discussion about who should replace David Warner. It's an absolute no-brainer, it has to be Cameron Bancroft. Leading run-scorer in the Sheffield Shield last season (945 runs @ 59.06, with four 100s and one 50), current leading run-scorer for the Sheffield Shield this season (512 runs @ 56.88, with two 100s and three 50s), plus a 50 in the PMXI game against Pakistan. The most consistent batter in Australia at the moment, and is also a specialist opener." Here is a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bancroft-renshaw-or-harris-the-big-call-over-who-replaces-david-warner-1414557">deep dive into the numbers of Bancroft, Harris and Renshaw.</a> If Shield runs are the only metric, Lyndon, you are right that it's a no-brainer. But the selectors don't look at Shield numbers alone. Mitchell Marsh averages 29 in Shield cricket in his career. Calum: "If they pick Green to open in a team with Marsh it will be trivial to reduce Green's bowling workload to compensate if he bats big. Watson bowled few overs while opening but added a lot of value, Green can too." Nicholas Frankl: "I think the commentary around moving Green or someone else to open is overblown. Plenty of players have moved up the order to open. Off the top of my head" Khawaja, Watson, Katich, Langer are four Australian examples. Overseas, Rohit Sharma is another example. Tom: "I'm not sure how Watson is relevant?Watson's average of 41 as an opener is nothing special, so I'm not sure that's a great argument for trying it with Green. Nor did Watson have Green's health concerns.Why wouldn't you just pick Bancroft? He's been the standout batsman in Shield cricket for a few years while opening for WA. It's a clear case of overthinking it when there's an obvious candidate right there." David Warner averages 45 across his career opening the batting and only 30 in the last three years. Watson's 41 is very good by global standards for openers. Bancroft and Harris average under 27 in Test cricket, Renshaw averages 29 overall but 33 when he opens. <strong>3.35pm</strong> Gnasher from the SCG: "Think there's a very good chance that this is it for the day. Doesn't seem to me any gaps in the rain. Forecast for the next three days is pretty good and we can make up time." Ahmed: "I don't get legends of the game saying back in their game they prioritized test cricket, i mean sure they did, but did they have T20 cricket? like today T20 is being prioritized for league contracts or whatever ETC. Back in the day test cricket was prioritized for county contracts, you simply cant say what they would've done if T20 was there at the time, although i agree test cricket is the purest and best form of cricket, its semi understood why players aren't prioritizing it." Earl: "Maybe there needs to stop being a Test in Sydney at the beginning of each year? If it rains around this time every year maybe either make the Sydney Test the 1st of summer or just don't host any matches in Sydney?" That would be controversial Earl. Tom: "Picking Green to open is madness. He's got a health condition that impedes his recovery, but we want him to bowl 10-15 overs and also open the batting? Why do people think this is a good idea? Is it simply because McDonald and co have been sending signals that they want Green back in the side?" Watson has done it with some success. He averaged 41 with the bat and 27 with the ball in the 25 Tests he opened the batting. It's a big workload and they would manage Green's bowling a lot more with Marsh also in the team. But if the selectors didn't think he could manage it then, or if Green didn't think he could do it, then it would never have been raised by them and they have consistently said all options are open including Green opening. <strong>3.25pm</strong> It's still raining and it looks like it will rain for awhile based on the radar. Fawad: "Cricinfo plz advise if we shud go to sleep or stay awake. " Enjoy your sleep Fawad. Mustafa Moudi : "Since the game is paused, lets come back to the important question - WHO REPLACES DAVID WARNER ??? My Answer would be Cameron Green. Head opens and Green replaces Head in the Middle Order!!" It won't be Head Mustafa. But Green is a live chance to do the job and Shane Watson thinks he has the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shane-watson-backs-cameron-green-as-test-match-opener-1415443">skillset to do it</a>. Tim: "Good debate on Fox about the state of Test cricket, and how the ICC and the cricket boards need to protect Test cricket. Here is a thought....Maybe the ICC and the boards in particular DON'T want to prioritise Test cricket. Money is in 20/20.  WI and SA have proven that beyond a doubt. Test's are an afterthought. The day will come when only AUS, IND, ENG and maybe NZ play Tests." AdnanKapri: "@Mustafa: My Answer is Renshaw (Proper Test Opener). Head and Green both should play in Middle order. " <strong>3.10pm The large covers are on. There is drizzle</strong>. Here is the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR713.loop.shtml#skip">Sydney radar</a>. Dera: "Time to put this phrase out once again, '3 things that are eternal - death, taxes and rain during Sydney's NY Test'" <strong>3.05pm The hessian cover has being put on the pitch. It has started raining. It is only a drizzle.</strong> The bigger covers are being driven onto the ground and rolled onto the square now. <strong>3.03pm</strong> Umpire Michael Gough is taking a light reading via is light meter at the moment. The umpires are now talking with Pakistan team director Mohammad Hafeez. <strong>2.58pm</strong> Tea will end at 3pm but it doesn't look like we will get back on straight away. The weather is closing very fast. The umpires are out in the middle having a chat to ground staff in the middle at the moment. The players are still sitting inside. Andrew: "I'm no weatherman, but the radar is saying we might as well call stumps." Luigi: "These issues have been going on and on for years, and everytime people seem to get angry with it - but nothing changes. What will it take to make actual change occur? " <strong>2.40pm Early tea taken.</strong> Some common sense shown at least with tea called while they are off. Zia: "I am half an hour's drive from the SCG and its raining pretty heavy here." Here is the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR713.loop.shtml">Sydney radar</a>. The rain missed the SCG yesterday but we might not be as lucky today. Viggo Pedersen: "Leave off the umpires!They are in the middle and if they think Jamal's bowling is a danger to the batsmen in the existing light then they are right to give Pakistan the option they did.They have umpired 96 tests between them. I think they know their stuff." It's a fair point Viggo. They probably took a reading off the light meter and are just doing what the rules say. But it certainly looked playable. Labuschagne and Smith were not having any trouble with the light. <strong>2.33pm</strong> The umpires have left the field. Gnasher reporting in from the SCG: "With the rain approaching it's hard to see the light improving in the short term now the umpires have set their benchmark. With the health of Test cricket very much on the agenda, this stoppage will no doubt prompt the debate around bad light and whether more needs to be done to keep the game going." TotallyFair: "So bowling bouncers to tailenders as Umpire and fielders couldn't see the ball yesterday was OK. But today isn't ok. Right....." <strong>2.23pm The umpires have called Pakistan together and light is a problem! Even with the lights on they all head off for bad light!</strong> This is strange. There has been no danger to the batters. Fox Cricket are reporting that the onfield umpires offered Shan Masood the chance to bowl spin from both ends but he wanted to keep Jamal going and so they have gone off for bad light. Amazing. Rain is rolling in shortly anyway but they could be playing now. Munro: "Cricket shoots itself in the foot, again." Mal: "There may not have been any danger to the batters, but there was a very real danger of bowling the allotted overs within the day, which obviously is a massive no-no." Caleb: "Bad light at 2:30pm in the afternoon in the middle of summer, is this some kind of joke?? I think every think of a time where it is too dark at 2:30pm to play cricket unless it was some massive tropical storm. "

In the post-match presser, Usman Khawaja vehemently opposed the idea of using the pink ball in Tests, stating, 'The red ball is Test cricket.' He added that if the pink ball is used, then he's retiring, emphasizing the impact of a change in balls Essar Banday: "Who says Test cricket is dull? I am waiting for the game to get started. In India, it's 4 am and I can't wait for the action to resume. Aamer Jamal" I think it's just a conversation topic with no real substance. Test cricket is very much alive and a supremely entertaining format, especially on lively sporting pitches <strong>Andrew McGlashan from SCG: </strong> Morning from the SCG. First thing to say is that it's dry and fine at the moment. There was the occasional light morning shower and there are a few more lingering around the coast. The pitch is uncovered and the players warming up. So fingers crossed we get a clear day. It's also the annual pink day for the Jane McGrath foundation. The SCG really gets behind this great cause Neal: "Third day is moving day and Pakistan need to bowl Australia out before stumps to have any chance to gain control." Waz: "@Gonez the reason being playing/bowling for 8 hours is already a large physical task, stretching that out by an hour or two would be unfair on the bowlers" "Yes, that will increase a day's workload <strong>9.34am</strong> Salman Ali Agha couldn't have mistimed his toilet break any worse. He went away for an over, and Saim Ayub was stationed at first slip, where he dropped an absolute dolly, giving another life to David Warner. However, Warner didn't make full use of that reprieve. Here's more on Pakistan's first slip woes <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/not-again-saim-ayub-adds-to-pakistan-s-first-slip-woes-1415453">Not again! Saim Ayub adds to Pakistan's first slip woes</a> "For a long period of time, he was in people's faces and doing stuff; but that wasn't always Davey," Khawaja said. "He was getting told to play a certain way by the coaching staff and people around at certain points. He's such a team player. If you ask him to do something, he'll do it. That's the frustrating part when people come at him because I know he'll do anything he needs to for the team to win a game." <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/usman-khawaja-on-david-warner-reputation-he-was-told-to-play-certain-way-1415490">'He was told to play a certain way' - Khawaja on Warner's feisty reputation</a> by Andrew McGlashan "Perhaps the scorecard doesn't quite do justice to the opportunity Pakistan have here at the SCG in this final Test. Of the 47 fairly routine overs that were sent down on a grey second day in Sydney, there was one ball that provided Pakistan a faint glimpse into what a good third day might look like. And all things good that come through here run through the man who bowled it" More from Danyal Rasool's Day 2 Analysis: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/spin-friendly-scg-pitch-keeps-agha-salman-and-pakistan-hopeful-against-australia-1415491">Spin-friendly SCG pitch keeps Salman, and Pakistan, hopeful</a> Gomez: "We lost 4-5 hours yesterday, why only start 30 minutes early today? why not start 1 hour early? And why must we stop at 6pm, when it i still daylight (in most cities in Australia)" Those are some brilliant questions <strong>9.20am</strong>: Hello, everyone. It's good to be back for what promises to be a fantastic day. Rvel Zahid and Alex Malcolm with you again to bring you all the action. Both teams are set to jostle for ascendancy after rain played spoilsport on Day two. Pakistan will search for early wickets and aim to bowl Australia out with some lead to go into the second innings. Let's see who will win the crucial morning session. Play starts half an hour early to make up for lost time due to bad light and rain. Marnus Labuschagne looked solid yesterday, but he'll have to restart his innings and get into the flow again. Meanwhile, Aamer Jamal was in the middle of a hostile spell and considering the kind of memorable series he's had, we can expect more fireworks from him. The spin duo of Salman Ali Agha and Sajid Khan created pressure and got assistance from the track, which has started to wear and tear. Most importantly, it's pleasing to see bright sunshine and clear skies welcoming us, much to the delight of players and fans alike We'll have a 30-minute early start tomorrow. Make sure to join us; we will have plenty of action for you, and the skies are expected to be clear as well. The game moved along nicely and Pakistan came back after a solid opening stand between Usman Khawaja and David Warner. Mir Hamza was relentless and accurate, and so was Aamer Jamal - buoyed after his spirited 82-run knock. Salman Ali Agha extracted plenty of turn and has become better as this series progressed; he got the prized wicket of Warner. Pakistan maintained good pressure and reaped the rewards for it. They will come with fresh legs in the morning session tomorrow and try to bowl the hosts out with some lead but Australia have a long batting lineup and they will look to stitch up some handy partnerships to erase the deficit. It should be a fascinating day of play. For now, it's goodbye and goodnight from Alex Malcolm and Rvel Zahid. We look forward to your company tomorrow! See you then! <strong> 4.52pm Stumps on day two. Play has been officially called off for the day</strong> Speaking of the state of Test cricket globally, the team on Around The Wicket, ESPN's new TV show, discussed the issues on the most recent episode Nauman: "Actually these breaks are good for Pak bowlers, keep them fresh. And Marnus who was settled has to start again. A little bit of moisture that may have snuck into the pitch may also assist them for a couple of overs after resumption." Ferdous : "People is comparing football with cricket which I dislike most. Cricket is at his place and football is another subject. There are lot of cricket fan like me who enjoys all format of cricket. So I don't see any devaluation of test cricket " The umpires are lurking on the outfield with umbrellas pointing up, which is not a good sign. They are having a serious chat out there or maybe just planning a dinner because it's still drizzling and the covers are drenched in rain so there's a fleeting prospect of any play Hamza: "Football is more aggressive field game than cricket and doesnt halt in rain. We are in advance tech era, should be some solution regarding rain so beautiful moments of game are not haltes/destroyed by it." Well we could have more stadiums with retractable roofs The way Pakistan plays and how a wicket often spurs them into action, it looks like they have been more affected by the rain. Aamer Jamal just got Usman Khawaja, and Pakistan had an opening to pick a few more in a cluster. So, it was in Pakistan's interest to carry on with that momentum in overcast conducive conditions Jason: "I am not sure the constant mention of Mitch Marsh's career Shield average as a way to devalue Shield statistics is valid.  Marsh had a horror start to his career but has averaged above 40 in Shield cricket since start of 2017/18 season with an unbeaten century in his only innings last season." Rain was not an issue for me to play cricket; in fact, it gave me an extra reason to play during the monsoon season in Lahore, mostly on my rooftop. Yes, there were occasional slips and challenging conditions, but we braved them Zain Ali: "Just waking up, how many catches did Pakistan drop? How difficult were they? And who were the culprits?" Saim Ayub at first slip dropped Warner in the 14th over. It was an absolute sitter Nicko: "I want Green to succeed, but he is beyond the (somewhat hyped) promising stage now with 24 tests. He averages 33.59 in tests (lower than his bowling average), far below his FC average. I suspect the problem is confidence and surety not technique. Being nervy starting doesn't augur well for opening. Or is it just spin where that is a problem? Or not at all?" <strong>4.24pm: </strong> Doesn't look like it will get dramatically better anytime soon, but I'm keeping an eye on the sky and will keep you updated if the heavens spring a surprise Scott Boland has been released from the Australian squad to return to the Melbourne Stars. He will return to Melbourne tomorrow for the match against the Sydney Sixers at the MCG on Saturday Mal: "Much as I'd love to see Green back in the side, I think I would pick Bancroft. Warner's counter-attacking batting stye and fast scoring rate helps push opposition bowling attacks onto the defensive, but we really don't have a similar replacement. Building a solid platform can help Head and Marsh at 5 and 6 tee off to push the scoring rate back up. Meanwhile I'd see what I could do to groom Green or a Shield player to become more of an aggressive opener, to replace Khawaja in time." Not much is happening yet--just steady rain. The forecast looks good for the next three days and given that we've had two four-day Tests, there is plenty of time left to have a result in this game Taimoor Hassan : "Why not simply slot Josh Inglis at the top, replace Carey, and include Green at number 7? This way, you'll have a few overs from Green, and he'll also get the much-needed rest. More bowling options mean greater variety. It's rare to see any team with five genuine 135-plus pacers in the playing eleven. Additionally, on a square-turning pitch, Hazelwood can be omitted for an extra spinner, still leaving four fast options. " Nauman: "Mitch Marsh finally fulfilling the expectations in his 30s gives me hopes that Faheem Ashraf might be world class in 3-4 years time." <strong>4.06pm</strong> The match is beautifully poised and it's such a shame that we lost too many overs due to this prolonged rain interruption. There's no activity on the ground and the squares are still under cover <strong>4pm</strong> Still raining. Rvel to step into commentary. <strong>3.45pm</strong> Lyndon: "I really don't know why there is so much discussion about who should replace David Warner. It's an absolute no-brainer, it has to be Cameron Bancroft. Leading run-scorer in the Sheffield Shield last season (945 runs @ 59.06, with four 100s and one 50), current leading run-scorer for the Sheffield Shield this season (512 runs @ 56.88, with two 100s and three 50s), plus a 50 in the PMXI game against Pakistan. The most consistent batter in Australia at the moment, and is also a specialist opener." Here is a <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bancroft-renshaw-or-harris-the-big-call-over-who-replaces-david-warner-1414557">deep dive into the numbers of Bancroft, Harris and Renshaw.</a> If Shield runs are the only metric, Lyndon, you are right that it's a no-brainer. But the selectors don't look at Shield numbers alone. Mitchell Marsh averages 29 in Shield cricket in his career. Calum: "If they pick Green to open in a team with Marsh it will be trivial to reduce Green's bowling workload to compensate if he bats big. Watson bowled few overs while opening but added a lot of value, Green can too." Nicholas Frankl: "I think the commentary around moving Green or someone else to open is overblown. Plenty of players have moved up the order to open. Off the top of my head" Khawaja, Watson, Katich, Langer are four Australian examples. Overseas, Rohit Sharma is another example. Tom: "I'm not sure how Watson is relevant?Watson's average of 41 as an opener is nothing special, so I'm not sure that's a great argument for trying it with Green. Nor did Watson have Green's health concerns.Why wouldn't you just pick Bancroft? He's been the standout batsman in Shield cricket for a few years while opening for WA. It's a clear case of overthinking it when there's an obvious candidate right there." David Warner averages 45 across his career opening the batting and only 30 in the last three years. Watson's 41 is very good by global standards for openers. Bancroft and Harris average under 27 in Test cricket, Renshaw averages 29 overall but 33 when he opens. <strong>3.35pm</strong> Gnasher from the SCG: "Think there's a very good chance that this is it for the day. Doesn't seem to me any gaps in the rain. Forecast for the next three days is pretty good and we can make up time." Ahmed: "I don't get legends of the game saying back in their game they prioritized test cricket, i mean sure they did, but did they have T20 cricket? like today T20 is being prioritized for league contracts or whatever ETC. Back in the day test cricket was prioritized for county contracts, you simply cant say what they would've done if T20 was there at the time, although i agree test cricket is the purest and best form of cricket, its semi understood why players aren't prioritizing it." Earl: "Maybe there needs to stop being a Test in Sydney at the beginning of each year? If it rains around this time every year maybe either make the Sydney Test the 1st of summer or just don't host any matches in Sydney?" That would be controversial Earl. Tom: "Picking Green to open is madness. He's got a health condition that impedes his recovery, but we want him to bowl 10-15 overs and also open the batting? Why do people think this is a good idea? Is it simply because McDonald and co have been sending signals that they want Green back in the side?" Watson has done it with some success. He averaged 41 with the bat and 27 with the ball in the 25 Tests he opened the batting. It's a big workload and they would manage Green's bowling a lot more with Marsh also in the team. But if the selectors didn't think he could manage it then, or if Green didn't think he could do it, then it would never have been raised by them and they have consistently said all options are open including Green opening. <strong>3.25pm</strong> It's still raining and it looks like it will rain for awhile based on the radar. Fawad: "Cricinfo plz advise if we shud go to sleep or stay awake. " Enjoy your sleep Fawad. Mustafa Moudi : "Since the game is paused, lets come back to the important question - WHO REPLACES DAVID WARNER ??? My Answer would be Cameron Green. Head opens and Green replaces Head in the Middle Order!!" It won't be Head Mustafa. But Green is a live chance to do the job and Shane Watson thinks he has the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/shane-watson-backs-cameron-green-as-test-match-opener-1415443">skillset to do it</a>. Tim: "Good debate on Fox about the state of Test cricket, and how the ICC and the cricket boards need to protect Test cricket. Here is a thought....Maybe the ICC and the boards in particular DON'T want to prioritise Test cricket. Money is in 20/20.  WI and SA have proven that beyond a doubt. Test's are an afterthought. The day will come when only AUS, IND, ENG and maybe NZ play Tests." AdnanKapri: "@Mustafa: My Answer is Renshaw (Proper Test Opener). Head and Green both should play in Middle order. " <strong>3.10pm The large covers are on. There is drizzle</strong>. Here is the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR713.loop.shtml#skip">Sydney radar</a>. Dera: "Time to put this phrase out once again, '3 things that are eternal - death, taxes and rain during Sydney's NY Test'" <strong>3.05pm The hessian cover has being put on the pitch. It has started raining. It is only a drizzle.</strong> The bigger covers are being driven onto the ground and rolled onto the square now. <strong>3.03pm</strong> Umpire Michael Gough is taking a light reading via is light meter at the moment. The umpires are now talking with Pakistan team director Mohammad Hafeez. <strong>2.58pm</strong> Tea will end at 3pm but it doesn't look like we will get back on straight away. The weather is closing very fast. The umpires are out in the middle having a chat to ground staff in the middle at the moment. The players are still sitting inside. Andrew: "I'm no weatherman, but the radar is saying we might as well call stumps." Luigi: "These issues have been going on and on for years, and everytime people seem to get angry with it - but nothing changes. What will it take to make actual change occur? " <strong>2.40pm Early tea taken.</strong> Some common sense shown at least with tea called while they are off. Zia: "I am half an hour's drive from the SCG and its raining pretty heavy here." Here is the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR713.loop.shtml">Sydney radar</a>. The rain missed the SCG yesterday but we might not be as lucky today. Viggo Pedersen: "Leave off the umpires!They are in the middle and if they think Jamal's bowling is a danger to the batsmen in the existing light then they are right to give Pakistan the option they did.They have umpired 96 tests between them. I think they know their stuff." It's a fair point Viggo. They probably took a reading off the light meter and are just doing what the rules say. But it certainly looked playable. Labuschagne and Smith were not having any trouble with the light. <strong>2.33pm</strong> The umpires have left the field. Gnasher reporting in from the SCG: "With the rain approaching it's hard to see the light improving in the short term now the umpires have set their benchmark. With the health of Test cricket very much on the agenda, this stoppage will no doubt prompt the debate around bad light and whether more needs to be done to keep the game going." TotallyFair: "So bowling bouncers to tailenders as Umpire and fielders couldn't see the ball yesterday was OK. But today isn't ok. Right....." <strong>2.23pm The umpires have called Pakistan together and light is a problem! Even with the lights on they all head off for bad light!</strong> This is strange. There has been no danger to the batters. Fox Cricket are reporting that the onfield umpires offered Shan Masood the chance to bowl spin from both ends but he wanted to keep Jamal going and so they have gone off for bad light. Amazing. Rain is rolling in shortly anyway but they could be playing now. Munro: "Cricket shoots itself in the foot, again." Mal: "There may not have been any danger to the batters, but there was a very real danger of bowling the allotted overs within the day, which obviously is a massive no-no." Caleb: "Bad light at 2:30pm in the afternoon in the middle of summer, is this some kind of joke?? I think every think of a time where it is too dark at 2:30pm to play cricket unless it was some massive tropical storm. "

CA should offer those at the SCG discounted or a free BBL ticket for not getting value for money. Before rain arrived players should have also been signing autographs. Make the experience better."

<strong>Joseph now bounces out Labuschagne!</strong> What a start to his Test career already. Bangs it in at 141 kph, Labuschagne instinctively goes for the pull despite not being in complete control. Finds the lone man at long leg to perfection. Motie had to run backwards but does so and takes it just inside the rope. Labuschagne is not happy but Shamar might not know, because he has gone way beyond point in celebration!

<strong>Softie, driven straight to cover!</strong> Motie slows the pace, 78ks, and is rewarded. Above-the-eyeline full ball had Marnus step forward and drive a tad too early. The bat face opened as he hit it. Ends up scooping it off the pitch to Greaves. May have stuck in the pitch, Motie and West Indies will take that.

Khawaja and Labuschagne will soon be out there facing a New Zealand attack that will be buoyed by Henry's late strike in the morning session. There is still plenty on offer for the pacers.

Well, like I said, there is still plenty in it for the seamers, so it may be a while before we see GP or Rachin Ravindra rolling their arms over.

Nice ball. Fulish just outside off, scrambled seam, Marnus walks down and pulls his leg back to stay inside the line as he leaves
