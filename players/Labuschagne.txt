<b>big turn and he's struck on the back leg!</b> Was it outside the line...? Umpire Kettleborough thinks so but SA <b>review</b>, and this looks to be stone dead on replay. Huge break back and he's caught on the crease looking to defend. But wait, it's tight on Hawk-Eye, and umpire's call is the final verdict! Wow. Frustration for SA as Labuschagne survives

<strong>big appeal, and given lbw! </strong>Labuschagne misses the reverse sweep. He's called the <strong>review</strong>. He's not hit it. Clipping leg stump. Not by much, but enough
Now then, now then...four down, 80 to get. Still a good few overs for Maharaj and Shamsi. And it's Glenn Maxwell at No. 6. How will he play? Backward short leg in place. And a slip
