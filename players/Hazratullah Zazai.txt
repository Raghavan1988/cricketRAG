<strong>6:58pm</strong> We are all in readiness. A new opening pair for Afghanistan tonight, with Zazai being joined by Gurbaz. Mathews has the new ball for Sri Lanka. Two slips in place - here we go! Jamil Faizi: "Hope Afghanistan will end up with a good win." <strong>Pitch Report:</strong> The pitch looks very patchy, and it seems dry underneath. There is a bit of hardness, although there might be a bit of turn on offer, if the ball pitches in those patchy areas. Changes of pace and not bowling them short could be key for the pacers, reckons Tino Mawoyo. Sachith: "Sri Lanka going for 2 fast bowlers with a slingy action. First time we've seen them in the same XI?" -- Yes, it is the first time Pathirana and Thushara are playing a T20I together for Sri Lanka. <strong>6:45pm</strong> Plenty of changes across both teams, which is not a huge surprise. Mohammad Ishaq will be making his T20I debut for Afghanistan today, and will hope for a positive outing. For Sri Lanka, Kamindu Mendis, Kusal Perera, Nuwan Thushara and Akila Dananjaya come in for Binura Fernando, Charith Asalanka, Dhananjaya de Silva and Maheesh Theekshana. <strong>Afghanistan XI:</strong> Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Hazratullah Zazai, Ibrahim Zadran (c), Mohammad Ishaq, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Karim Janat, Sharafuddin Ashraf, Noor Ahmad, Fareed Ahmad, Wafadar Momand <strong>Sri Lanka XI:</strong> Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis (wk), Kusal Perera, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Kamindu Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dasun Shanaka, Wanindu Hasaranga (c), Akila Dananjaya, Nuwan Thushara, Matheesha Pathirana <strong>6:30pm</strong> <strong>Afghanistan have won the toss and they have elected to bat first.</strong> <strong>Zadran</strong> says the surface looks good and that they want to put runs on the board. The focus will be on getting the basics right. <strong>Hasaranga</strong> says he would have bowled first anyway. Adds that they want to bring their A-game to the table today as well and end the series with a win. <b>6:20pm</b> There could be a few changes in the Sri Lankan side today, with captain Wanindu Hasaranga indicating as such at the post-match presentation a couple of days ago. If that happens, the likes of Akila Dananjaya, Dilshan Madushanka, Kamindu Mendis and Nuwan Thushara could get a go. Afghanistan, on the other hand, might look to retain their complement, hoping that they come good, finishing what has been a winless tour so far, on a high. <strong>6:10pm</strong> Before Sri Lanka's bowlers came into their own, it was Angelo Mathews, making his comeback into the T20I fold, whose blitzkrieg took the hosts to an above-par total. But as Andrew Fidel Fernando writes, the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/angelo-mathews-seeks-to-improve-further-after-starring-in-successive-series-1421882">veteran wants to keep improving</a> with every passing game. <b>6pm</b> The three-match T20I series has been decided. Sri Lanka have been full value for both of their wins. Their bowlers held their nerve, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-1st-t20i-1416077/full-scorecard">defending a middling total in the first T20I</a>, before they <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2023-24-1416068/sri-lanka-vs-afghanistan-2nd-t20i-1416078/full-scorecard">blew Afghanistan away</a> in pursuit of a much higher target on Monday. Their batters have also batted with intent throughout, and while it has not always come off, there is a sense that this is the way to go. Afghanistan, meanwhile, have struggled. Their bowling attack has withered away promising situations, failing to capitalise in each of the two games so far. Their volatile batting line-up, while extremely talented, has imploded rather than exploding. What then is there to look forward to, you may ask? Well, plenty. The T20 World Cup is not far away, and both of these sides, despite the shortcomings that may exist currently, will have lofty ambitions. When that T20 World Cup comes around, they will need to be at their best, and their best possible chance perhaps lies in making the most of these opportunities. Against a rival that they might well be competing against for the honours that really matter in four months' time. Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's live coverage of the third and final T20I between <b>Sri Lanka</b> and <b>Afghanistan.</b> I am Shashwat Kumar and I will bring to you all the action from Dambulla. The series may have been decided, but there is still lots to gorge on!
