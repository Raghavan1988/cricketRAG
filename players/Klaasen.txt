Vish: "If we can talk about the Semis, there are lots of scores to be settled among the 4 teams. Aus haunted SA both in 1999 and 2007, India in 2003 and 2015, and NZ in 2015. India paid back Aussies in 2011. NZ drowned SA in 2015 and India in 2019. Only India and SA haven't met in ODI WC knock-outs yet. So there's your finalists."

Turn again, beats bat again. Litton takes off the bails, not sent upstairs by the ump. Was a fullish ball that landed outside off and went away (legbreak), Klaasen tried pushing to cover with a straight bat

<strong>Extra bounce has Klaasen pull out of the cut</strong>, big turn too. Klaasen tried to hop across and cut it like he did in the first ball, but the slightly fullish ball ragged away to keep the bat from going through with the swing

Not short by any means but Klaasen stays upright and carves it to the left of deep-backward point. In fact, he hopped leg side to make room after the ball was delivered. Luckily, the bounce was even

Darted again, 93ks, inside edge onto pad. Was a length ball that landed around middle and may have spun in a bit, Klaasen tried to punch to long-on off the back foot but got his feet jammed and, thus, cramped for room
Deepankar DM : "I think if we are appreciative of exceedingly low-scores in every game, high scoring games shouldn't be criticised in the name of "lack of balance between bat and ball". There has been a blatant lack of balance this tournament as well but it has not come into question. The ask of fans seems clear - keep the scoring low and see batters struggle."

Back of length, 131ks, cramming in above leg stump, Klaasen has to tuck the open-faced blade back towards him to dink it to backward point. Tanzim ends his day with 3 for 18, impressive figures

<strong>Klaasen slogs across the line and this pitch swindles him like it has many other batters</strong>, the bounce is low and the seam movement takes it further in to dink top of leg stump. No pace off the pitch at all. The crowd find their voice again. Miller has his arm around Klaasen and has a word. Excellent stand this btw
