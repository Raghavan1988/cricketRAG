Vish: "If we can talk about the Semis, there are lots of scores to be settled among the 4 teams. Aus haunted SA both in 1999 and 2007, India in 2003 and 2015, and NZ in 2015. India paid back Aussies in 2011. NZ drowned SA in 2015 and India in 2019. Only India and SA haven't met in ODI WC knock-outs yet. So there's your finalists."

Met the ball with hard hands, and the ball popped up off the bat. Sudharsan ran forward and then dived forward before getting his fingertips under the dipping ball. Super acrobatic.

Tejas: "With the Euros on, I'd like to know Cricinfo's opinion on whether it would be a good idea to have a Quarterfinal - Semifinal - Final knockout format, as is the case with many sports. This reduces the length of the tournament, giving players some rest, and also puts in jeopardy with every team needing to play well in every game. Super 8s allow for leniency in 1 - 2 games." More knockouts = better tournament
