A false start, as Adair runs in but doesn't deliver. He will reload and go again <strong>1pm</strong> Wessly Madhevere and Tadiwanashe Marumani are out in the middle. And it's Mark Adair who will start proceedings with the ball. One slip in place for Madhevere. Yoel: "In the long run, Raza's suspension might be a blessing in disguise for Zim. Time for other players to stand up and show leadership." That's definitely a positive Zimbabwe can take from the situation. <strong>Paul Stirling</strong> says they brought in an extra spinner and hope to restrict Ireland and that the pitch doesn't deteriorate. <strong>Sean Williams</strong>, standing in for Raza, says he would have bowled as well. He says they got in an extra batter in place of Raza, as the wicket looks more bowler-friendly. Williams says a 150-plus total should put them in a good position. Mark: "Two sides that have been struggling for some years to reproduce past glories and that both need desperately some success. And both sides that are struggling to get meaningful international cricket. The ICC needs to ensure that the lesser Full Members play enough games to rebuild." ShahSafeer: "Sikandar Raza has been winning games for his team, scoring fifties, whacking sixes and getting PotM awards for a fun for quite a while. Surely one of the shining white ball cricketers across the world. Sadly he has to miss ODI world cup due to lack of competence of his team and even worse to know he won't be playing the T20I world cup either!! " And he won't be playing the rest of this series either, sadly. <strong>12.45pm</strong> So Ireland have handed a debut to allrounder <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/theo-van-woerkom-547760">Theo van Woerkom</a>, in place of Barry McCarthy.

Sean Williams will lead Zimbabwe in his absence. He has also been fined 50 per cent of his match fees. Campher and Little, meanwhile, have been given one demerit point each and fined 15 per cent of their match fees. <strong>12.25pm</strong> Craig Ervine had to pull out of the series opener quite late due to a groin niggle.

We'll have our answers in about five minutes at the toss. <strong>12.15pm</strong> Can Ireland level the series?

Wessly Madhevere c Balbirnie b Adair 9 (10b 1x4 0x6 14m) SR: 90
<strong>Adair has his second as he bounces out Madhevere!</strong> Adair goes short again, takes the pace off again, and Madhevere is early into the shot and ends up spooning the ball up to midwicket's right. Balbirnie has to move to his right and put in a short dive to hold on to that, and he does. Ireland's catching was impeccable when not spectacular in the last game and Balbirnie continues that trend. The ball hit the splice of the bat and ballooned up

<strong>1pm</strong> Wessly Madhevere is out to open alongside Tinashe Kamunhukamwe, who has been promoted to the top of the order after batting No. 3 yesterday and impressing. One slip in place. Mark Adair steams in <strong>Ryan Burl</strong> says they would have batted first anyway. "Obviously a knock when you lose three experienced players, but it gives opportunities to three youngsters. " <strong>Stirling said at the toss:</strong> "I think it held pretty well together throughout the last week. Hopefully that will happen today and the new pitch is closer to one of the boundaries." <strong>Pitch report:</strong> It's a hard surface with a bit of grass. Ball could come onto the bat nicely, so batting first may have been the way to go. But Stirling is happy to chase. <strong>Team news:</strong> Ireland have made one change. Theo van Woerkom, who bowled just the one over on debut, goes back on the bench with Barry McCarthy returning. Zimbabwe, meanwhile, have done a major reshuffle. Williams is out with injury and Burl is the captain. Marumani and Gwandu also make way, with Masakadza, Munyonga and Mavuta coming into the team. <b>Zimbabwe:</b> W Madhevere, T Kamunhukamwe, B Bennett, T Munyonga, R Burl (capt), C Madande (wk), B Mavuta , L Jongwe, W Masakadza, R Ngarava, B Muzarabani <b>Ireland:</b> P Stirling (capt), A Balbirnie, L Tucker (wk), H Tector, C Campher, G Dockrell, M Adair, G Delany, Barry McCarthy, C Young, J Little Mustafa Moudi: "With 2 last over thrillers already in this series, this series is one of the most competitive and entertaining bilateral series in the recent time despite featuring associate nations. Hoping for another nail biter today !!" They are both Test playing nations, Mustafa! <strong>12.30pm</strong> <b>Ireland win the toss and bowl!</b> The chasing team has won both games so far. Will the trend continue?! Anmol : "How many times have a team had 3 different captains in a 3 match T20 series? Reminds me of when both captains (Morgan and Seelar) retired in the middle of the Eng vs Ned ODI series. If I recall correctly, back in the day when WI used to play home tests, each island used to select its own West Indies XI, and have its own captain." I honestly can't remember! It could well be the first time! <strong>12.25pm</strong> Sean Williams said that 150-plus would be a good total batting first in a day game in Harare, but their total of 165 was chased down, albeit with just two balls to spare. So it will be interesting to see how the team batting first approaches the game today. <strong>12.20pm</strong> Allrounder Ryan Burl was the acting captain yesterday when Sean Williams had to leave the field after bowling just one over. If Williams is out, Burl is set to be the 11th man to officially captain Zimbabwe in T20Is. <strong>12.15pm</strong> Two games, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/sikandar-raza-s-involvement-in-t20i-series-against-ireland-ends-with-ban-1412020">a ban with huge consequences</a>, multiple twists and turns later, here we are for the series deciding third T20I between Zimbabwe and Ireland.

Today is another day game and Zimbabwe are being seriously stretched thin, with Sikandar Raza banned and his deputy Sean Williams likely out with a side injury suffered in the second game. If Williams can't play today and Craig Ervine also hasn't recovered from a groin niggle that has kept him out of the first two games, Zimbabwe will have to dig deep into their reserves. How will it play out today? I'm Abhimanyu and I'll be bringing you all the action from the third T20I in Harare.
