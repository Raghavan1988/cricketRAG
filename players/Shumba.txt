<strong>9:17pm</strong> That is that, the game has officially been called off. A frustrating finish in the end. Sri Lanka will take heart from the fact that their vice captain made an excellent century and that their new-ball bowling was on point. Zimbabwe had their moments but couldn't build on promising positions. They will have a chance to make amends in a couple of days. See you then.

Nope, but it's been close to an hour since the interruption. Generally, that's when overs start getting reduced, 4.2 minutes for each over. Sanjeewa: "Rain stopped in Kandana but still lightning. Hope the rain will get cleared soon in Colombo as well" <strong>7:09pm</strong> The stumps are being pulled out, we have a rain interruption. Roshan Abeysinghe says the umps might be worried by the lightning as well. The groundsman are covering the ground quickly. It's a steady drizzle for now. The BBC forecast has the chances of rain in the 30-to-50-percent range rain for the next couple of hours. Let's hope it isn't as bad and that the weather clears up and we get a full game. Shamlan Malik : " I am at the stadium and it's raining heavily with lightning. I don't foresee any play for at least the next hour. " Thilini comments a couple minutes later that "The rain seems to be slowing down slightly about 10km away from the stadium.

A reduced game might make it easier, as will the two early wickets. Sanjeewa: "It's pouring in Kandana 15 KM away from Colombo. So this can be be the last over of the match"
