Thomas is OUT! lbw
lbw b Zampa
Oshane Thomas lbw b Zampa 7 (9b 1x4 0x6 10m) SR: 77.77
Beats the slog sweep and hits the back leg. Given lbw right away, reviewed. Full and floaty at 76ks, landed around middle and leg and straightened. Went below the bat. Nothing on Hotspot or Snicko. Hawk-Eye shows it's hitting top of middle
AussieFan: "11 game winning streak for Oz since the World Cup loss against SA!" They have the chance to extend that run and clean sweep West Indies in Canberra. That's just a couple of days away. See you then. Thanks for tuning in tonight, hope you had fun. <strong>Steven Smith, Australia captain</strong> It was a nice finish. Challenging start, WI bowled well, was a tricky surface. Late-middle order played well. I thought 250 was about par, then we did really well with ball. Frase looked like he was enjoying himself. Sutho was really good, bashed it on a length. Nice to see them debut. Canberra is a nice wicket, hope to <strong>Shai Hope, WI captain</strong> I thought we stuck to our guns with the ball. Must commend our bowlers. 258 wasn't too much. Challenging wicket, Aussies bowled well. We need to find ways to score more freely. We have to win one, that's the plan. <strong>Sean Abbott, POTM</strong> The situation I found myself in, we had to be risk free. We thought 220 would be competitive but were very competitive with partnerships taking it over 250. It's a hard attack to get into with the bowlers around. They're very good to put it lightly. It's such a good environment that your cricket is moving forward. I've been enjoying it. Love getting out there and playing in front of a home crowd. I got only game in the WC, lot of game time before, certainly allowed me to get into the nets and train in different conditions. Staff have helped me train as well. It's been a pleasure. <strong>9:36pm</strong> Australia's 83-run win helps them clinch the series. Sean Abbott starred with the ball like he did earlier with bat. West Indies were in with a chance when they had 91 for 5 but the hosts stitched decent partnerships regularly to finish with 258 on a pitch where 220-odd seemed par. The chase had to start well if the visitors were to be in with a chance. But Hardie and Hazlewood removed the inexperienced openers within the first five overs. Kjorn Ottley looked solid at times but tried to drive Abbott up and over cover and got nicked off. Hope was solid but with 29 off 65, it was real slow. Keacy Carty was more brisk, he stitched a decent stand with the skip but Abbott again got his man.
