what a ball to get first up. Angling in, pitching and seaming, hitting him in front. Given out lbw. They decide they may as well review it. This has seamed away like a legcutter and clearly missed the outside edge to hit his back leg. Umpire's call on impact and progression. The on-field decision stays. Avesh on a hat-trick
