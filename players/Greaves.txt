Greaves is OUT! caught
c Khawaja b Starc
Justin Greaves c Khawaja b Starc 6 (10b 1x4 0x6 19m) SR: 60
<strong>Starc does have his third!</strong> Another outside edge and this time Khawaja takes it low. The umpire has sent it up for a check, though. This was a length all on off that was leaving Greaves. He had his bat up as he looked to defend, but it went off the edge. Goes low to Khawaja, but that went to his hands and Greaves has to go. Starc stamps Australia's authority on the session
<b>Pat Cummins</b>: "350, that's a lot. He [Starc] was impressive. He is the most resilient bowler. He always wants to play, even sometimes when he shouldn't." <b>4.05pm</b> Right then, that will be the dinner break. There was a period of five-six overs where West Indies batters were scoring briskly, but that aside, it has been all Australia. West Indies have lost half their side, with Mitchell Starc taking three in an excellent second spell. He has, of course, gone past 350 Test wickets now. Starc's treble came after Josh Hazlewood drew first blood and then Pat Cummins ended Kirk McKenzie's aggressive cameo. Join Alex in about 40 minutes when the action resumes.
