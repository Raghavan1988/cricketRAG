Change of plan. The field is set for a short-ball barrage. No slip, but a catching gully. Three men out on the leg side. England's run rate has nudged up past 6 an over. Shiva: "Rohit Sharma has been looking totally clueless and just waiting for the batters to commit a mistake rather than enforcing them to commit a mistake. The field set has been pedestrian." Geoff: "It's testament to just how much Bazball has shifted the paradigm that I saw India had scored 450 (in India) and my first thought was, "Ooh, that's not gonna be enough.""

India will miss Ashwin's runs in the third innings, for sure, but it is in the bowling where India are now most vulnerable. Barring Jasprit Bumrah, the other India bowlers had a torrid time yesterday, and today, they will not only have to do better but do so with different tactics in mind. Day 3 also presents <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/joe-root-303669">Joe Root</a> a terrific chance to return to form, having scored only 52 runs in four innings so far. Mind you, the Rajkot pitch still looks like a solid batting strip. Mahi: "Do India field with 10 players as well?" -- No, there will be a substitute fielder during India's bowling innings. <B>Note from BCCI:</b> The India team will be wearing black arm-bands today in memory of Dattajirao Gaekwad, the former India captain who <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/dattajirao-gaekwad-indias-oldest-test-cricketer-dies-at-95-1420920">died at 95</a> earlier this week. <B>Pitch report:</b> The general view is that there is some green tinge and some cracks, but the cracks haven't gotten too wide.

But one more session of Duckett dominance will tilt this game in England's favour. Sanket: "England has the chance to take this game away from India.

Jadeja has got turn here, which means he might just be good for line. He has beaten the bat too. Waiting for ball tracking now. Pitches just outside off, umpire's call on impact, and umpires call on off stump too. Wow that run of luck with Egland again

<strong>huge huge never-ending shout</strong> for lbw as he has beaten him on the sweep. Not given, and India review. We all predicted sweeping is not going to be easy because of low bounce here. Jadeja has got turn here, which means he might just be good for line. He has beaten the bat too. Waiting for ball tracking now. Pitches just outside off, umpire's call on impact, and umpires call on off stump too. Wow that run of luck with Egland again

On the subject of the openers, here's Brian: "This is now the longest opening partnership of the series for ENG, passing the 89 off 13.1 overs in the 3rd Test. But it is also far slower than the other 6 partnerships that passed 40. The next slowest was 50 off 10.5 at a RR of 4.6 in the 2nd Test."

<b>skied to cover, well held!</b> Kuldeep gets the breakthrough in his first over. Tossed up and Duckett's eyes are wide as he looks to launch over the leg side, only to get a b-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-g leading edge. Shubman Gill has to turn and scurry back a good 20 yards but makes the ground and holds on to a diving catch. Spin does the job for India on a morning for the seamers
