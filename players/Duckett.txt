Shiva: "Rohit Sharma has been looking totally clueless and just waiting for the batters to commit a mistake rather than enforcing them to commit a mistake. The field set has been pedestrian." Geoff: "It's testament to just how much Bazball has shifted the paradigm that I saw India had scored 450 (in India) and my first thought was, "Ooh, that's not gonna be enough."" Ahsan: "Did India not learn any lessons from England's tour to Pakistan last year? You DO NOT give this England side a flat deck to bat on"
