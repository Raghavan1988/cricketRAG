Thanks, Deiva. Honestly I didn't think we'll get in even this much amount of play this morning when it dawned dark and gloomy in Pretoria. But all the weather predictions have been proven wrong and we've had a beautiful, at times blustery, day so far. Hope it'll stay that way. A fascinating contest is brewing.

<b> cops a blow on the helmet! </b> Effort ball from Coetzee, Shardul is surprised by the fizz off the pitch but takes him on with the hook shot. Ends up playing a tad late as the ball cannons into the side of his helmet. <B> Bowled at 142kph </b>
Shardul's helmet is off. He's feeling his forehead. The physio is running his mandatory concussion checks. They're also bringing in a new set of helmets. Shardul seems to be pointing to some pain. It appears as if there's some swelling on his forehead. Kamlesh Jain, the physio, is now applying ice to the swollen area. He's wearing a new helmet. It seems ad if he'll carry on batting.
