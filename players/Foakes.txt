"This is currently the slowest 50 partnership of the Bazball error, with a RR of 2.54," claims Caleb, and he seems a trustworthy sort.

"I'd love people to realise at some point that England's top order aren't good enough for 'proper test batting'," says Simran. "Bazball is just about maximising their potential and output by having them play in attacking manner. Pope, Root and Foakes, all have the skills and first-class record to play in this way, and so when the situation requires it, they do."
