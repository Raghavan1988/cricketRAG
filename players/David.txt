The crowd rises to Glenn Maxwell. West Indies go up and congratulate him. Another magnificent display from him. He's having an extraordinary win in international cricket. Australia were a little uncertain at 64 for 3, but Maxwell soon took charge. A knock that won't be forgotten in a while. And it's a huge total (<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask/cricket-qna/highest-total-in-Australia&tournament=menst20i">Australia's highest on home soil</a>). Hard to see West Indies chasing it, but they'll have a crack. Alex will be with you shortly. "It was good fun," Maxwell tells Fox Cricket. "Just gave myself a chance. It's a really nice wicket. Nice to cash in and spend most of the time out there. I've always relied on my hand speed to get me out of trouble...and it really seemed to work for me today."

<b>West Indies win by 37 runs</b> and close the series to 2-1. A very good performance from the visitors. Their recovery with the bat was remarkable through Rutherford and Russell. Australia, led by Warner, made an excellent start to the chase but Chase (the Roston version) was outstanding with the ball and Australia lost all momentum around the mid part of the innings. Shepherd and Joseph also played their part with the ball. Both sides will take plenty from the series - for Australia, some key players will return in New Zealand. Reckon both sides are pretty close to knowing their T20 World Cup 15s. Maybe a spot or two for each to mull over? <b>Andre Russell</b> is player of the match, but didn't catch his interview. Sorry. <b>David Warner</b> is player of the series. "It was good to have a break and play the franchise stuff. I've got a lot of time off after the New Zealand series, go to the IPL before we embark on a World Cup in the Caribbean. Was quite surprised an opening bowler 145kph and swings it not trying to get me out. Go the Caribbean, the boundaries aren't too big there. I'm well and truly done, it's time for the youngsters to come through and show their talent." <b>Rovman Powell</b> "It's a very good feeling to come here and get a win. The Australia team is such a strong team and understands their conditions. The boys showed some heart and courage. We had good plans through the three games but execution let us down. We sat down as a bowling group but 240 runs is too many. It's always good for players to have confidence and we told him [Rutherford] to relax, you are an integral part of the team. As captain going into the World Cup it's a lot of thought and things I need to think about it." <b>Mitchell Marsh</b> "Thought we were in a great position, went for the kill to try and get a few more wickets. We were on the wrong end of it, fair play to West Indies. We saw that throughout the series, they bat down to No. 10. They are a great unit but thought we played some really good cricket in the first two games. Been nice to see our young guys come in and do well. We'll go to New Zealand next week with a pretty full strength team." So, that wraps up the home season for Australia's men. But there's plenty more cricket to come, starting with the women's Test match (also in Perth) from Thursday then the men head over to New Zealand for T20Is and Tests. We'll be back to bring you the Test in a couple of days but until then, from Gnasher and Alex, it's goodbye and thanks for joining us.

<b>West Indies win by 37 runs</b> and close the series to 2-1. A very good performance from the visitors. Their recovery with the bat was remarkable through Rutherford and Russell. Australia, led by Warner, made an excellent start to the chase but Chase (the Roston version) was outstanding with the ball and Australia lost all momentum around the mid part of the innings. Shepherd and Joseph also played their part with the ball. Both sides will take plenty from the series - for Australia, some key players will return in New Zealand. Reckon both sides are pretty close to knowing their T20 World Cup 15s. Maybe a spot or two for each to mull over? <b>Andre Russell</b> is player of the match, but didn't catch his interview. Sorry. <b>David Warner</b> is player of the series. "It was good to have a break and play the franchise stuff. I've got a lot of time off after the New Zealand series, go to the IPL before we embark on a World Cup in the Caribbean. Was quite surprised an opening bowler 145kph and swings it not trying to get me out. Go the Caribbean, the boundaries aren't too big there. I'm well and truly done, it's time for the youngsters to come through and show their talent." <b>Rovman Powell</b> "It's a very good feeling to come here and get a win. The Australia team is such a strong team and understands their conditions. The boys showed some heart and courage. We had good plans through the three games but execution let us down. We sat down as a bowling group but 240 runs is too many. It's always good for players to have confidence and we told him [Rutherford] to relax, you are an integral part of the team. As captain going into the World Cup it's a lot of thought and things I need to think about it." <b>Mitchell Marsh</b> "Thought we were in a great position, went for the kill to try and get a few more wickets.

<b>10.36pm</b> That was a fun, high-scoring thriller. It boiled down to the last ball, with Australia needing four off it and David did the job for Australia. Australia go 1-0 up in Wellington, with two games to go in Auckland. Brace yourselves for more big scores at Eden Park. Boult is set to return to international action there. So, plenty to look forward to at Eden Park. That's all we have for you from this game. Until next time, this is Deivarayan Muthu signing off on the behalf of Alex Malcolm.

"Timmy David is extremely calm and has got a lot of confidence in his ability towards the end there," he says. "We're very lucky to have him. Just a great game of cricket. Any time you chase down 216 is a great effort. We just got over the line by the sheer brilliance of Tim David. We've got the Test series starting in a week so our bowlers will likely rotate. We've also got guys like Steve Smith who will come in for a crack at some point in time." <b>Mitch Santner</b>: "I thought we didn't bowl too bad. But the power they possess all the way down is the reason why they're pretty good. [215] was a pretty good score. I guess we know they keep coming with the bat. The only way to stop them is to keep taking wickets and we didn't really do that today. It was a hell of a game of cricket. We've just got to reflect and move on. When the Bison (Mitch Marsh) can mis-hit it for six it means I might have to go to the gym to get some arms like that." Srividya : "So Australia continue to silence crowds across the world ! And they did silence a very hostile crowd tonight " Kiran: "Good game with a view to the World Cup. I was surprised that NZ didn't give another of their bowling options a go when it was going poorly in the middle just to experiment. " James: "The real winner tonight was cricket.

<strong>Milne returns and bags the big wicket of David!</strong> Milne pounds it on a heavy length and just outside off, the ball hits the bat as opposed to bat hitting the ball. Spliced into the hands of Santner at extra-cover. Aus are in danger of being bowled out at Eden Park

<B>10.12pm</b> Australia end then on a well above par 164 for 5. Oman had them worried for the first half of this innings but a potentially game-defining stand of 102 from 64 deliveries between Stoinis and Warner took the game away. Both batters bided their time on a tricky surface, before Stoinis turned on the afterburners. On a wicket such as this all it took was one or two big overs, and Stoinis delivered on that front while Warner played the anchor role to perfection. Steep chase for Oman, Abhimanyu will back for the start of that in a bit.

That's it. <b>Scotland have been knocked out. England are through to Super Eight</b>. It was in the slot, full on off and middle and David smashes it over deep midwicket
That's all from our side for this game. Hope you enjoyed our coverage. See you soon. A heartbreak for Scotland. A relief for England, who join West Indies, South Africa and USA in Group 2 of Super Eight. <b>Mitchell Marsh</b>: We spoke about sticking to our game. Scotland are a pretty good outfit and have improved a lot in the last few years. We spoke as a group to stay really consistent in how we want to play. Having already qualified, there was little less pressure on us. The World Cup kind of starts again now. It's going to be a busy schedule. T20 is a hard format. We are excited for what's to come. [On chat about England] I think more externally than internally. <b>Richie Berrington</b>: I thought we were in a pretty good position at the halfway mark. Unfortunately we couldn't capitalise towards the end. We had a really good start with the ball but we couldn't execute it for long enough. A few big overs towards the back end got them back into the game. There was a breeze at the ground, so we were just trying to get them hit away from the breeze. I think the guys can hold their head high. We played some really good cricket throughout the tournament. It was a great learning for us. Obviously we are a bit disappointed given the position we were in. We came here to qualify but couldn't do that. vagnur: "This just shows how scary Australia is. Not doing it all, but winning against a spirited scotland team" Krish : "Pheww!! England can sleep peacefully now..." <b>Marcus Stoinis is the Player of the Match</b>: "The plan was to get yourself in and hit it hard along the ground. And then access from there. There's a strong breeze, which meant that end was easier to hit from. The pitch was also very good. Head picked his bowlers and pretty much turned the game in that over with three sixes even though he got out. I have been fortunate to play consistently for the last 3-4 months starting with the IPL but there's no substitute for confidence. That's the recipe we all try to keep a hold of." <B>11.50pm</b> A valiant effort by Scotland but Australia were too good in the end. They posted a competitive 180 and were ahead at the halfway mark in the chase. At one point, Australia needed 89 from seven overs. Head and Stoinis shifted gears then and David joined in later and finished it off with two balls to spare.
