Nice to cash in and spend most of the time out there. I've always relied on my hand speed to get me out of trouble...and it really seemed to work for me today." From Sampath: Glenn Maxwell's 120* is the <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?batting_positionmin1=4;batting_positionval1=batting_position;class=3;filter=advanced;orderby=hundreds;template=results;type=batting;view=innings">second highest T20I score while batting at No.4</a> or lower, behind Shaheryar Butt of Belgium who scored 125* vs Czech Republic in 2020 while batting at No.6. james: "Maxi is still not out in any of this century knocks!! wow !!" Afeef: "Funnily enough, Maxwell equalled Rohit's T20I centuries tally in December, then in January Rohit pulled ahead, and now in February Maxwell has equalled him again."
