van Meekeren is OUT! lbw
lbw b Thushara
Paul van Meekeren lbw b Thushara 3 (8b 0x4 0x6 11m) SR: 37.5
given lbw! But was there bat on that? Van Meekeren reviews immediately. There doesn't seem to be bat, and van Meekeren was only reviewing because they had reviews to spare. It looked plumb initially. This was swinging in to middle, was very full, and smashed the batter on what would have been his front pad, only he'd switched legs as he attempted to play a scoop. As plumb as it gets, really.
That's it from us folks. In the end, two deserving teams go through from Group D - both green machines. Madushka Balasuriya is prepping the report, and look out for more stories later. We'll see you at the next one. <b>Wanindu Hasaranga</b>: "After the bad first two games this win is very healthy for us. The wicket was really good we just wanted to put a 160-170 score on this wicket. With our attack anything over 160 we can defend. In the first two games we lost two or three wickets in the first six overs. Today we didn't. I think that was the difference. Asalanka has a lot of talent and he proved today what he could do. Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva also played a role." <b>Scott Edwards</b>, Netherlands captain: "The wickets were better than we have been playing on, and the margins of error were a bit smaller, and we missed a little bit. With there being a shorter side and the wind going that way - we were slow to react to that. We have to be better at that. "We had good patches throughout the tournament where we gave our chances to win at least three of those games. But something was slightly off and against good quality sides you can't afford that. In the batting we needed someone to have a big innings, and we weren't able to do that. Backing our boys to come back firing." So Sri Lanka dominant across disciplines today. A couple of errors in the field, but their batting was dynamic, with their lower-order hitting finally getting going. We knew their bowling would test Netherlands, and the likes of Pathirana, Hasaranga, and Thushara made an impact. Atiq: "Thank you, SL, for trying your best for BD. We supported you wholeheartedly. Ultimately, we prevailed through our own efforts. Now that the competition is over, we can return to our friendly rivalry." <b>Asalanka</b>, player of the match: "These are far better conditions than the USA, and we enjoyed those conditions. It can be tough to come in at No. 5. We just played the conditions. I know I have to be a little more consistent. In general we are a little disappointed about the results in the first two games. But in the end we had a good game here." So, we know without a doubt who the Group D qualifiers are now. South Africa are through. As are Bangladesh. For Netherlands to win they had to win big. They lost big instead. Frankie: "Well played commentary jinx" Eeek. Yes, apologies to Scott Edwards.
