the man from long leg chases it all the way to his right, and pulls the ball back, although the third umpire will have a look. Yup, it's a save from Young, who pushes the ball back with his right hand. Adair went on a length to Jamal, getting to shape back into his pads, with Jamal clipping behind off his pad

<strong>bowled him!</strong> Young has another, as Jamal is almost shaken there. This hits the top of middle, as Jamal looks to clip this with only a half-closed face of the bat. The bounce on this pitch has been true throughout the day, and Young went on a length on middle, getting the ball to angle in. Jamal missed, and the ball sneaked through the gap between bat and pad

<b>What have you done Jamal?</b> Looks to leave a full delivery that pitches just outside off, but this one doesn't spin and hits the off pole! The line was too close to the stumps for Jamal to leave, especially on a pitch where it's not turning a lot yet! He will be disappointed with that. Maybe the fact that Jayasuriya almost drew the outside edge with the previous delivery played on his mind
