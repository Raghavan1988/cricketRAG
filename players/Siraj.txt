fires this in, follows Siraj as he backs away. It is mis-hit towards long-on, and the lack of pace on that shot allows them a second
<b>6.45pm</b> South Africa will be extremely happy with that finish. Just the 40 runs in the last four overs especially when India looked set for a big finish. A quick start from Jaiswal followed by a slowdown - 17 off the last 17 balls he faced, including 10 balls to go from 43 to 50 - and a sensational acceleration from Suryakumar Yadav ending up in his fourth T20I century, but South Africa managed to drag India back in the end. At this point, I dare say this might not be par

Arshdeep Singh run out (Babar Azam/†Mohammad Rizwan) 9 (13b 1x4 0x6 26m) SR: 69.23
ooh, driven in the air, but it doesn't carry to mid-off. But Pakistan get their wicket anyway, because there's a mix-up. Full, angling in towards leg stump, following Siraj's attempt to create room. Drives and almost yorks Babar at mid-off. He picks up and throws to the keeper's end, because while Siraj set off immediately, Arshdeep was slow to respond. Nowhere in the picture as Rizwan collects and whips off the bails. India are bowled out with an over to spare
<b>1.39pm</b> Well, well. Pakistan need exactly 120 to win. A run a ball. This isn't a straightforward pitch to bat on, but for a large chunk of the India innings it looked like the best pitch New York has served up so far at this World Cup. I don't think India will be pleased with this total, but how far is it from par? And how will Bumrah and Co do? These are the big questions leading into the chase. Here's <b>Mohammad Amir</b>'s verdict: "I think we did well as a bowling unit, but this is a decent total on this track. We need to bat well and sensibly. It's a bit tricky. We need to start well and finish well." Given those words, you would think India aren't out of this. Let's hope we have a humdinger of a finish. Danyal will be here shortly to bring you the start of the chase. Elsewhere, India said farewell to their greatest ever footballer in Sunil Chhetri recently. <a href = "https://www.espn.in/football/story/_/id/40297497/sunil-chhetri-gone-next-igor-stimac-indian-football" target = "_blank">How can they deal with his departure</a> and can India still keep their World Cup hopes alive? Akbar: "If you are thinking Pakistan have made it easier for themselves, I believe they have given 20 runs too many. Having watched their performance recently and the condition of the pitch, it isn't going to be all that easy." ravi: "this match is definitely Pakistan's. India were eyeing 150  from the start - taking risks - losing wickets. But the target is clear for Pakistan and how they need to bat. " Ajay: "This target will suit babar-rizwan style of battingIndian batsmen certainly couldn't read the pitch."

low full-toss outside off, jabbed towards that deep cover fielder again, and Siraj sprinted out for a second, so the fielder throws at his end as he hurries back that way. Not the best of throws, and the bowler can't collect cleanly either - he may have been unsighted by Siraj running across him - and India get another overthrow
