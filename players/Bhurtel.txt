Length ball angled across, Bhurtel hangs his bat out and is lucky that he is beaten on the outside edge

Big bounce on that one! Jansen bangs it in short around leg, Bhurtel backs away and looks to cut but is beaten by the bounce. Good take by QDK, sticking up his arm as he jumps up and just about plucking it out of the air. Saves a possible four runs there!
