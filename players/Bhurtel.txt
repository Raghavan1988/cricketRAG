<strong>1.08pm</strong> Welcome back. Nepal have restricted USA to 207, but it could have been so much worse for USA who were 18 for 4 at one point. They will have to put up a good bowling effort, though, to make a match out of it. The teams are out in the middle. Netravalkar has the new ball from over the wicket. Two slips in place, Burtel to take first strike.

Length ball, not a lot of movement, around off stump. He gets across and defends to mid-off.

<b>9.15pm</b> Marco Jansen has the new ball in hand. Kushal Bhurtel's job isn't done after his four-fer, he is out to open the innings for Nepal alongside Aasif Sheikh. There's one slip and one leg slip fielder. <strong>9.10pm</strong> Thanks Madushka, and hello again, everyone. Well, what do you know, Nepal have given themselves every chance of picking up two points today! It was the spinners who did the job for Nepal, and South Africa only have one frontline spinner in Shamsi. Markram may have to put in a shift with the ball today as well. shivaraj: "never thought Nepal's win percentage is that higher than south Africa.hope we win the greatest match of our carriers till now." Neal: "Just tuned in, how should Nepal approach this chase to pull of the ultimate upset, Madushka?" Madushka has tuned out, sadly, but to answer your question, they would be best served trying to consistently rotate strike and not take unnecessary risks on a turning track. And they need to watch out against Nortje and Rabada of course!
