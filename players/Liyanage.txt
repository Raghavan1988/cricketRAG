Dan: "Is Janith Fast Medium bowler or a Medium Fast Bowler? Also wondering, where was he all this time?" --- Not sure the exact classification, but he generally clocks mid 120s. Also, in SL there are a lot of promising guys on the domestic circuit, but it's quite tough to gauge how well they'll translate that to international cricket untill they actually play. He's had to bide his time.
