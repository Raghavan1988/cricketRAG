Another back of length delivery angles in from outside off, Chandimal looks to fend and it goes off the inside edge onto his foot and bounces over the stumps!

The monitor lizard is still there just inside the boundary rope! Officials are trying to now get him/her to leave the arena! And yes, climbs back over the rope and now scurries away. Goes past some kits lying on the ground before scurrying away further!

Length ball seams in sharply from outside off and Chandimal nearly chops on! Goes for the cut, gets cramped for room, and ends up underedging it onto the ground

<strong>has Mathews been run out?! Bangladesh are very confident!</strong> Back of a length outside off. Chandimal tips it into the off side and calls Mathews through. Mathews was a touch late to react. He has to stretch every sinew to make his ground, and might be in trouble, with the Bangladesh captain hitting the stumps. All eyes on the replay...<b>and it shows that Mathews is indeed short of his ground. Oh dear, just what Sri Lanka did not want at this stage!</b>

Chandimal is OUT! caught
c Mehidy Hasan Miraz b Shoriful Islam
Dinesh Chandimal c Mehidy Hasan Miraz b Shoriful Islam 9 (13b 0x4 0x6 24m) SR: 69.23
<strong>the leg slip ploy works a charm!</strong> Back of a length delivery on the pads. Chandimal feels he can glance this fine and pick up some runs. The problem, though, is that a fielder is stationed for exactly that stroke. He cannot keep it down either, and he helps it towards leg slip, who swoops down low to his left and snares it, inches off the ground. But hang on, just hang on. The third umpire has been called in to check if this was a clean catch. <strong>The ball, Rod Tucker says, has carried but he just wants to be sure if the fingers are underneath. He looks at multiple displays, and decides that the catch should stand. Perhaps the right call, and SL lose another!</strong>

<strong>is there a nick?!</strong> Back of a length delivery angled across the batter outside off. Chandimal goes fishing at it away from his body and there seems to be a noise as the ball passes the bat. The umpire is unmoved, though, and Bangladesh, after deliberation, decide against the review too. Clear gap between bat and ball, and Bangladesh did well to not go upstairs!
