Yorker angling across off, whisk it away to backward point and that's the highest score by New Zealand at this venue
Finn Allen pummeled 16 sixes in his terrific knock and helped his team put up this colossal total of 224. He was striking at 221.0 and made life easier for his teammates. Pakistan made three changes to their lineup, but they were still expensive. Rauf leaked 60, Shaheen 43, Nawaz 44, and nothing really worked for them. They managed to slow things down a little bit towards the death after Allen got out, but now Pakistan will have to bat out of their skins to chase down this massive total to stay alive in this series. I'll ice my fingers and will be back soon with Pakistan's reply.

Zubair Dar : "Pakistan's preparations for the T20 world cup is getting a reality check - their bowling is in tatters, their batting doesn't have the sting it will need to compete and their overall strategy for games is quite questionable. I am wondering if this team has hit the rock bottom yet?! "

Ish Sodhi c Iftikhar Ahmed b Mohammad Amir 5 (3b 1x4 0x6 4m) SR: 166.66
Leg-cutter on a length wide outside off, swings big but doesn't control his bat and Iftikhar at mid-off is called into action again, he tracks the ball, settles under at takes an easy catch, it's his third catch.
New Zealand have managed to put a respectable total of 178 runs for the loss of seven wickets, a target that Michael Bracewell had in mind during the toss. The top-order provided solid contributions, with Robinson scoring a well-orchestrated fifty, Blundell got a start, and Foxcroft added 34 valuable runs but the innings slowed down after first 10 overs. Abbas Afridi was exceptional in his second spell, took 3 wickets for 20 runs. Usama Mir had a tough day at the office, while Zaman Khan struggled with his length and lines, which proved costly in the end. Imad Wasim didn't perform at his best, having spent considerable time on the bench but it's good for him to get some match-time. The score is close to par but the dew factor may come into play so Pakistan will fancy themselves to track it down. If successful, it would be the highest successful run-chase against New Zealand in T20Is. I'll be back after a short break, stay tuned!
