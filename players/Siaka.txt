Lega Siaka b Hosein 1 (2b 0x4 0x6 2m) SR: 50
<b>Timbeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr! Hosein slices through him!</b> A wicked delivery from West Indies' left-arm spin doctor, angling back in with the arm - almost an inswinger, really. Beats the inside edge and rattles middle and off. Siaka heads off after a two-ball stay
Sese Bau is in at No. 4

Lega Siaka c †Rahmanullah Gurbaz b Fazalhaq Farooqi 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0
<strong>edged and taken beautifully by Gurbaz!</strong> Length in the channel just outside off. Does not swing back in, instead going on with the angle. Siaka nibbles at it and the ball hurtles off the outside edge, almost off the shoulder of the bat. Gurbaz flies to his right and shows excellent athleticism to snare the chance with two hands. Afghanistan have their second in the powerplay!
