<strong>Anderson's first ball in the WC for USA dismisses the well set Dhaliwal</strong>. Cutter on a full length angling in and he tried to lash it through the line. The lack of pace meant he was into the shot too early and got it off the bottom of the bat, ball popped straight to Jasdeep at long-off. Again, a good innings from an opener
Stat from <b>Sampath</b>: Navneet Dhaliwal's 61 is the highest individual score by an associate player on men's T20 World Cup debut. Previous highest was 56 by Asad Vala vs Oman in 2021.

Huge, huge appeal for caught behind, but the umpire stays unmoved. Little is convinced, the keeper and slips not so much. Not out and no review taken. Was an absolute jaffa that pitched on middle and shaped away. Oh, hang on. Looks like he did get some glove on that through to the keeper. No wonder Little was sure.
