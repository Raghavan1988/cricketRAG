Thanks Alex. Been a difficult day for Sinclair with the ball but he has got a huge wicket here. Well deserved backflip there! Can they wrap up Australia's innings quickly now?

Fires it in very full on off at 140kph and Nathan Lyon does well to clip it away square along the ground to bring up Australia's 250

Silly point and leg slip come in

short outside off, Lyon drops his hands on it
And that's <b>stumps</b> on the opening day in Christchurch. Dominated by the bowlers with 14 wickets falling. Australia finish on top, but New Zealand - through Matt Henry - have just about kept themselves in it. Marnus Labuschagne has worked hard to emerge from a lean run of scores. Earlier, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/hazlewood-s-mastery-floors-nz-at-hadlee-s-hometown-1424013">Josh Hazlewood was outstanding</a> with a five-wicket haul after Pat Cummins opted to bowl first. This contest is already well advanced and you suspect it will continue to move quite swiftly, whichever way it goes. "Very cool," says Ben Sears on claiming Steven Smith as his first wicket. I'll wrap things up there for today. You can flick over and <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-india-2023-24-1389386/india-vs-england-5th-test-1389403/live-cricket-score">follow the India-England Test here.</a> For now, from Gnasher and Ekanth, it's goodbye and see you in the morning.
