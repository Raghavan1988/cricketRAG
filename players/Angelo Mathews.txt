<B>10.06pm</b> The Netherlands then will need 202 to win here as Sri Lanka's batters finally made their mark at the World Cup, becoming the second team to surpass the 200 mark at this tournament! Sri Lanka racked up 77 runs in the final five overs, as Mathews, Asalanka and Hasaranga all unleashed at the death. There were also platform-setting knocks from Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva prior to that, which meant that the Dutch were never able to get a foothold in the innings. Fidel will join you in a bit to take you through the chase.

Saleem from over the wicket Thanks Abhimanyu. Scoring rate has slightly dipped then after the loss of those two wickets this morning, but still healthy 4.40 rpo in the first hour - that's largely been down to Dimuth Karunaratne who's continued striking at better than run-a-ball. Worrying though that Afghanistan have completed just overs so far, even more dire than Sri Lanka's yesterday.

<B>12pm</b> Just the 23 overs in the session, another wretched one in terms of overrate, but there was plenty of action with 97 runs scored and three wickets falling. You'd have to say the session belongs to the visitors especially after they got the set Dimuth Karunaratne for a well made 72-ball 77. Following the fall of his wicket, Mathews and Chandimal played far more conservatively, happy to see the game out till the lunch interval. The wicket itself hasn't shown much assistance to the Afghan bowlers, though there has been some grip and turn for the spinners. The bowlers however have shown far more discipline in sticking to their lines, while Shahidi has been unorthodox with his field settings, which is what has paid dividends with three wickets. Join us then in about 35 minutes for the start of the second session.

short of a length outside off, goes back and punches this into the covers. And indeed that is <B>lunch</b>
<B>12pm</b> Just the 23 overs in the session, another wretched one in terms of overrate, but there was plenty of action with 97 runs scored and three wickets falling. You'd have to say the session belongs to the visitors especially after they got the set Dimuth Karunaratne for a well made 72-ball 77. Following the fall of his wicket, Mathews and Chandimal played far more conservatively, happy to see the game out till the lunch interval. The wicket itself hasn't shown much assistance to the Afghan bowlers, though there has been some grip and turn for the spinners. The bowlers however have shown far more discipline in sticking to their lines, while Shahidi has been unorthodox with his field settings, which is what has paid dividends with three wickets. Join us then in about 35 minutes for the start of the second session.

that's just wonderfully clever bowling. A topspinner I think, but tossed up very wide of the stumps - just inside those wide guide lines. Mathews attempts to smash another six because come on this ball is juicy. But the line, and the extra bounce from the top spin ends up with him top-edging it to long off, who takes a decent running catch.
