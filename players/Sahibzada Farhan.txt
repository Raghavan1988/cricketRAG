Sahibzada Farhan c Phillips b Ferguson 1 (2b 0x4 0x6 3m) SR: 50
<strong>Excellent catch from Phillips running back from midwicket and Farhan has to go!</strong> That was a mean short ball angled into middle and off, he decides to go for a pull but is troubled by the fierce pace and bounce, Ferguson with a fist-pump, gets the job done and more problems for Pakistan
