If you're in India, you'll have access to some specific clips from the Test. All the important moments. Hop over to our homepage to find them in the match centre. And in some news from down the road in Benoni, the opening day of the second unofficial Test between South Africa A and India A has been washed out without a ball bowled. The first game ended in a draw with India A taking the lead. Prasidh Krishna, who makes his debut here, picked up a hat-trick in that game. <b>12.30pm </b> Absorbing morning. Just when you were beginning to go 'what's new' from an Indian point of view - what with them 26 for 3 in the first hour - they've bounced back splendidly courtesy an unbroken half-century stand with Iyer and Kohli. Of course both of them have been aided by dollops of luck. Iyer was let off by Jansen at point, Kohli by de Zorzi at square leg. But since then, they've played some delightful strokes Before that, left-am pacer Nandre Burger had a fabulous initiation into Test cricket early, but him apart, South Africa would be the first to admit they've sprayed it around a fair bit. The rain has stayed away and the conditions are a lot brighter now with the sun shining. India will be hoping that helps ease the surface further. Join us in 40 minutes for the second session with Deivarayan Muthu back in with the controls. If you've missed much of the morning, big bro Alagappan Muthu's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-in-south-africa-2023-24-1387592/south-africa-vs-india-1st-test-1387603/live-match-blog-1">#LiveReport</a> is all you need for a quick recap. If you're a Proteas fan, you'll keep your fingers crossed for Temba Bavuma who seems to have done his hamstring while giving chase. He's off the field currently.

If you're in India, you'll have access to some specific clips from the Test. All the important moments. Hop over to our homepage to find them in the match centre. And in some news from down the road in Benoni, the opening day of the second unofficial Test between South Africa A and India A has been washed out without a ball bowled. The first game ended in a draw with India A taking the lead. Prasidh Krishna, who makes his debut here, picked up a hat-trick in that game. <b>12.30pm </b> Absorbing morning. Just when you were beginning to go 'what's new' from an Indian point of view - what with them 26 for 3 in the first hour - they've bounced back splendidly courtesy an unbroken half-century stand with Iyer and Kohli. Of course both of them have been aided by dollops of luck. Iyer was let off by Jansen at point, Kohli by de Zorzi at square leg. But since then, they've played some delightful strokes Before that, left-am pacer Nandre Burger had a fabulous initiation into Test cricket early, but him apart, South Africa would be the first to admit they've sprayed it around a fair bit. The rain has stayed away and the conditions are a lot brighter now with the sun shining. India will be hoping that helps ease the surface further. Join us in 40 minutes for the second session with Deivarayan Muthu back in with the controls. If you've missed much of the morning, big bro Alagappan Muthu's <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/india-in-south-africa-2023-24-1387592/south-africa-vs-india-1st-test-1387603/live-match-blog-1">#LiveReport</a> is all you need for a quick recap. If you're a Proteas fan, you'll keep your fingers crossed for Temba Bavuma who seems to have done his hamstring while giving chase. He's off the field currently.

<b>11.33am:</b> A cagey opening, but both sides started to land a few punches as the session wore on. Yashasvi Jaiswal found the balance between attack and defence to move past 50 for the fourth time in nine Test innings, but England will be content to have knocked a couple over on what looks a pretty benign surface.
