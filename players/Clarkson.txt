Clarkson is OUT! run out
run out (Shadab Khan/Mohammad Amir)
William O’Rourke run out (Shadab Khan/Mohammad Amir) 0 (0b 0x4 0x6 2m) SR: 0
Pakistan hold their nerve and get over the line. Amir bowls it full on middle and off, he spanks it down the ground towards long-on and the second was never on, Amir collects the throw calmly and whips off the bails. Pakistan win by 9 nine runs!<strong> Another enthralling contest that could've gone either way</strong> Shadab kept his cool and his throw was spot on, Amir collected it on one bounce and W O'Rourke was well short of his crease
And that brings an end to our coverage from Lahore. Another fascinating game of T20I cricket that had plenty of ebbs and flows, but in the end, Pakistan managed to hold their nerve. The way Seifert and Bracewell started, it looked like New Zealand were favorites to hunt down the target, but the spinners brought Pakistan back into the game and wickets in clumps stymied the run-flow. Those wickets in the middle overs derailed New Zealand's chase, but some timely hits kept them in the contest. Then, Shaheen Afridi's late killer blows sealed the game. Pakistan found some answers with their experimentation and rotation policy, but there is a lot of room for fine-tuning before the World Cup, while New Zealand have ticked all the boxes with a depleted squad that gave a full-strength Pakistan a run for their money and produced exhilarating contests both in Rawalpindi and Lahore! Both teams pose with the trophy, smiles, and handshakes all around. Thank you for joining us throughout the series. We'll see you soon with more action. On behalf of the entire team at ESPNcricinfo, this is <strong>Rvel Zahid</strong> signing off <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> Fast bowlers were also getting swing early on, but after powerfully when Usama started, we felt spinners were getting more assistance and we did what was best according to situation. Yes, we used 8 bowlers, four among them were spinners...yes it's a bit difficult when you have too many options. We tried Saim today like he bowled in PSL. Imad has so much experience that he can bowl well after the powerplay too. New ball comes nicely onto the bat but after the dew settles in, it gets slower and cutters hold up...think we were 10 runs short but in the end, the recovery was fair enough. It was a par score but I think we should have scored 15-20 runs more. As a batter, you have to be proactive, you have to mark your fielders, running between the wickets always helps you if you are struggling. (About the World Cup). Look, throughout the series we tried different combinations and we wanted to see where our bench strength stands. There are many good signs but we won't be complacent and will focus on improvement which is crucial in international cricket. <strong>Michael Bracewell, New Zealand Captain:</strong> Pretty fair reflection of the series, pretty happy with coming over here and learning how to play in these conditions. Credit to Pakistan, they played really well, think we lost a couple of wickets in the middle and that put us on the backfoot. Shaheen and Usama bowled particularly well. We were keeping the run rate (in check) but those wickets were the turning point. It's always a great challenge playing against great players in very different conditions, good to test yourself. I think the way we were able to learn and adapt game to game was really good <strong>Shaheen Afridi, Player of the Match:</strong> Always try to strike and look for wickets. Goal is always to do best for the team. When New Zealand were bowling, ball was keeping low, and there was a chance they could miss if we bowled wicket to wicket and do length bowling...if ball is reversing, I try to mix it up in the last two overs, yorker is the best delivery in every format of the game. I try to deceive the batters at the death. Padmaraj : "Just checking scores and found that the last three matches the target was same. Could be first instance of such a hattrick" Saifi: "He ran his partner out to get back to the strike only to other run out as well? He should've waited and tried to hit two big sixes" Lail: "Too many cook, spoil the broth.... Used Eight bowlers but almost loosing" Vaibhav: "Pakistan Pakistan PadosiyoPadosiyoCome on Come on " Zain: "Whoever wins this but this young NZ team have won many hearts here! " Ibrahim: "The commentators really brought enthusiasm to the game! Truly an enjoyable game. (" Waqas : "So stressful watching this Pakistan team!! Rvel, I really hope you get a stress bonus everytime you're commentating on Pakistan's matches."  haha Rizwan: "Rvel do you think a drawn series is really a loss for Pakistan?  Considering a weakened opposition" It's a reality check before the World Cup. A much better performance was expected, considering Pakistan were playing at home with all their first-choice players available MR: "15 runs remaining in 10 balls was very doable. NZ lost because of inexperience.  Pakistan needs to do some thinking here as this was Pakistan's best squad and the expected result was 5-0 (in favour of Pakistan)" Shaheen Syrda: "I think there will be no place for Iftikhar after the inclusion of Imad, Usman, and Azam and having Fakhar, and Shadab in the team. Instead, give a chance to some youngsters." Smartush: "Assalam o Alaikum Rvel, isn't is astonishing that few months earlier i was asking you about the curious case of Usman Khan that will he play for Pakistan or will PCB neglect him..Just how fast the night changes."

<strong>Thumps </strong>it many a mile with insolence way over long-on for a maximum! Picked the slow ball and dispatches it for a six, shortish and outside off, stretches forward and effortlessly clubs it over for a six.

William O’Rourke run out (Shadab Khan/Mohammad Amir) 0 (0b 0x4 0x6 2m) SR: 0
Pakistan hold their nerve and get over the line. Amir bowls it full on middle and off, he spanks it down the ground towards long-on and the second was never on, Amir collects the throw calmly and whips off the bails. Pakistan win by 9 nine runs!<strong> Another enthralling contest that could've gone either way</strong> Shadab kept his cool and his throw was spot on, Amir collected it on one bounce and W O'Rourke was well short of his crease
And that brings an end to our coverage from Lahore. Another fascinating game of T20I cricket that had plenty of ebbs and flows, but in the end, Pakistan managed to hold their nerve. The way Seifert and Bracewell started, it looked like New Zealand were favorites to hunt down the target, but the spinners brought Pakistan back into the game and wickets in clumps stymied the run-flow. Those wickets in the middle overs derailed New Zealand's chase, but some timely hits kept them in the contest. Then, Shaheen Afridi's late killer blows sealed the game. Pakistan found some answers with their experimentation and rotation policy, but there is a lot of room for fine-tuning before the World Cup, while New Zealand have ticked all the boxes with a depleted squad that gave a full-strength Pakistan a run for their money and produced exhilarating contests both in Rawalpindi and Lahore! Both teams pose with the trophy, smiles, and handshakes all around. Thank you for joining us throughout the series. We'll see you soon with more action. On behalf of the entire team at ESPNcricinfo, this is <strong>Rvel Zahid</strong> signing off <strong>Babar Azam, Pakistan Captain:</strong> Fast bowlers were also getting swing early on, but after powerfully when Usama started, we felt spinners were getting more assistance and we did what was best according to situation. Yes, we used 8 bowlers, four among them were spinners...yes it's a bit difficult when you have too many options. We tried Saim today like he bowled in PSL. Imad has so much experience that he can bowl well after the powerplay too. New ball comes nicely onto the bat but after the dew settles in, it gets slower and cutters hold up...think we were 10 runs short but in the end, the recovery was fair enough. It was a par score but I think we should have scored 15-20 runs more. As a batter, you have to be proactive, you have to mark your fielders, running between the wickets always helps you if you are struggling. (About the World Cup). Look, throughout the series we tried different combinations and we wanted to see where our bench strength stands. There are many good signs but we won't be complacent and will focus on improvement which is crucial in international cricket. <strong>Michael Bracewell, New Zealand Captain:</strong> Pretty fair reflection of the series, pretty happy with coming over here and learning how to play in these conditions. Credit to Pakistan, they played really well, think we lost a couple of wickets in the middle and that put us on the backfoot. Shaheen and Usama bowled particularly well. We were keeping the run rate (in check) but those wickets were the turning point. It's always a great challenge playing against great players in very different conditions, good to test yourself. I think the way we were able to learn and adapt game to game was really good <strong>Shaheen Afridi, Player of the Match:</strong> Always try to strike and look for wickets. Goal is always to do best for the team. When New Zealand were bowling, ball was keeping low, and there was a chance they could miss if we bowled wicket to wicket and do length bowling...if ball is reversing, I try to mix it up in the last two overs, yorker is the best delivery in every format of the game. I try to deceive the batters at the death. Padmaraj : "Just checking scores and found that the last three matches the target was same. Could be first instance of such a hattrick" Saifi: "He ran his partner out to get back to the strike only to other run out as well? He should've waited and tried to hit two big sixes" Lail: "Too many cook, spoil the broth.... Used Eight bowlers but almost loosing" Vaibhav: "Pakistan Pakistan PadosiyoPadosiyoCome on Come on " Zain: "Whoever wins this but this young NZ team have won many hearts here! " Ibrahim: "The commentators really brought enthusiasm to the game! Truly an enjoyable game. (" Waqas : "So stressful watching this Pakistan team!! Rvel, I really hope you get a stress bonus everytime you're commentating on Pakistan's matches."  haha Rizwan: "Rvel do you think a drawn series is really a loss for Pakistan?  Considering a weakened opposition" It's a reality check before the World Cup. A much better performance was expected, considering Pakistan were playing at home with all their first-choice players available MR: "15 runs remaining in 10 balls was very doable. NZ lost because of inexperience.  Pakistan needs to do some thinking here as this was Pakistan's best squad and the expected result was 5-0 (in favour of Pakistan)" Shaheen Syrda: "I think there will be no place for Iftikhar after the inclusion of Imad, Usman, and Azam and having Fakhar, and Shadab in the team. Instead, give a chance to some youngsters." Smartush: "Assalam o Alaikum Rvel, isn't is astonishing that few months earlier i was asking you about the curious case of Usman Khan that will he play for Pakistan or will PCB neglect him..Just how fast the night changes."
