There's the winning shot! Good length ball on the off stump, pushed through the covers for a single
So that's it for the time being. We genuinely appreciate you joining us, and it was a pleasure to have you here for the whole series. Make sure you join the Bangladesh tour of the United States on May 21 at Prairie View, Houston. Until then, here is Rashad signing off on behalf of Ranjith, Chetan, and the whole crew. Farewell and goodbye. <strong>Najmul Hossain Shanto: </strong> "The way we played in this series there's a lot of areas we can improve. Today I think the way Riyad and Jaker played really happy for them. Obviously, I think we didn't start well today. But there was an opportunity in the middle. Shakib also batted in the middle couple of overs. I am really happy with them. But in the world cup, I think we will prepare ourselves very well. (USA series) Another three match opportunity for ourselves to prepare and we will try our best there." <strong>Taskin Ahmed is the Player of the Series.</strong> <strong>Player of the Match Brian Bennett: </strong> "Very grateful for today. We came close in the last game but I am really happy for the team to go back with a victory, obviously not what you want from the series but a good effort from the team today. We have been backed and supported by the coaching staff. We have few youngsters in the team so I think we still have some time so let's see what happens in the future." <strong>Sikandar Raza: </strong> "Thank you very much. It's nice to go home with a win. Like we said in the last three games we were working our way closer and closer to the victory margin. It's nice to contribute. In the last last presentation I came here and said the only jigsaw puzzle that's missing is me scoring runs. If I can contribute towards the succession of the team it will give me immense pleasure. And today is one of those days. It's always nice to contribute towards the winning of the side. When we were losing on those little margins, I thought that was on me. But Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God). A lot of positives, I lost the series 4-1 but I can say that a lot of positives and we have something to work on for the future of the T20I cricket for Zimbabwe. I am very proud of the squad and I am sure these young guns will take Zimbabwe forward." Mamun : "If the series was longer, from this point Zimbabwe would have won the matches. They were just one or two shots away from winning the last two matches." TC: "@Ibrahim: You can't disregard Bennett's half century so easily" Yes, in fact. The youngster, who early on set the tone for Zimbabwe, played a superb innings. Tarif Sherhan: "although Bangladesh have clinched the series, no Bangladeshi batter in the whole series have played a more sensible innings than how Raza and Bennett batted today. Very well played! " Sayyid: "Batting constantly falters for Bangladesh, we cannot expect the old guard to give performances like today's and play on wheelchairs!⠀" A well-earned victory for the visiting team at last. They've been this close quite a few times previously, but they were unable to cross the finish line. This time, however, they managed to play as a cohesive unit and secure the series' first victory. Bennett led them into an explosive powerplay display. It was all about Bennett and Raza when Marumani left. The two batters put up a 75 runs stand between them.. With Bennett gone, Sikandar Raza's incredible strike that was hitting the ball all over the pitch made it a one-man show. He battled through agonising cramps to help his team win the game in spectacular fashion. While Mustafiz and Shakib bowled exceptionally well this afternoon, the other bowlers let them down. Mustafa Moudi: "Raza fails in the first 4 matches, and Zimbabwe lost all the 4 matches. Raza scores a Half-Century and Zimbabwe wins this match. Zimbabwe is too reliant on Skipper, which is not good for any team. Others need to step up too !!" Raza has stated repeatedly that he bears the primary responsibility for the ongoing losses. Zimbabwe is being severely impacted by his lack of runs. At last, he succeeded, and with Bennett's help as well, they managed to triumph and avoided the Bangla wash. I'm hoping that the other batters will play as a team and soon begin to contribute. <strong>Zimbabwe won the match by 8 wickets</strong>
