Pakistan managed to pull things back well in death overs as wickets fell at regular intervals. Allen smashed the ball all around the park in his blistering 74-run knock and some handy contributions from Conway, Williamson and Santner lower down the order pushed the score to 194/8. Five bowlers used, Rauf was great at death and picked three wickets, he bowled seriously quick tonight. I'll be back shortly Nate: "The commentators mentioned earlier that the average winning first innings score here is 197. NZ just a few short of that, but with Santner back tonight, they'll be confident of defending it." Sajjad: "Haris Rauf making me eat my words from the start of the match. Ultimately pace pace hai yaar!!!" Muhammad Shabn: "Missing Naseem Shah in Pakistan bowling attack " Rhys: "No team is winning a WC with run leakers like Rauf, Usama and Jamal in the team. They should have been giving Wasim Jr, Zaman (and Mohammad Haris as an opener) fair opportunities before WC instead of giving new players debuts. "
