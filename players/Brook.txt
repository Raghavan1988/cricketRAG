<strong>And Harry Brook has won it!</strong> Brook opens the face to lift a wide delivery over third to take England to a stunning victory by seven wickets! What a win, and what a way to keep the T20I series alive. Salt strolls off to a host of well-wishes from the West Indies players after his remarkable 109 not out held the chase together. Remarkable game of cricket
<strong>5.17pm:</strong> Right, now for a lie down after all that. Next stop is Trinidad and Tobago for the conclusion of this series. Join us on Tuesday for the 4th T20I. <strong>5.15pm:</strong> Jos Buttler, speaking after just England's second victory of this tour, is full of praise for Salt: "He's got such great intent from ball one. That's something we've asked him to do and he;s always played that way. But for him to go on and bat through, it's something we've spoken about as a team. Harry Brook as well, to come in and finish the game off as he did, was a great effort. "It's great to keep the series alive and get a win, you know? Winning games of cricket is what we're here for." <strong>5.10pm</strong> "It's massive," says Phil Salt - player of the match of course - about his maiden T20 century after a succession of starts. "There's a way to do it. You can't get 40 off 20 and then take 10 off 10 balls, it changes the complexion of the game." <strong>5.07pm:</strong> Sonny: "Suddenly feeling a lot better about the T20 WC defence. The best Jos has looked since the semi final down under and some unbelievable hitting from Salt, Livi and Brook. Incredible game of cricket!" Martin: "So often I find myself watching Harry Brook and all I can think is 'wow, I wish I could bat'." <strong>5.04pm:</strong> Harry Brook's match-finishing six was the 34th in the match, <a href="https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=3;filter=advanced;groupby=match;orderby=sixes;template=results;type=batting">the second-most number of sixes</a> in a T20I match. <strong>5.01pm:</strong> Neil: "Blown away and fully repentant of my earlier unbelief". You're not the only one, Neil! That''s the second most runs successfully chased in the 20th over of a T20I.

It'll be very different conditions in the Caribbean next week, but England will travel with confidence after two good warm-up wins. As for Pakistan, they'll be what they'll be. Never write them off, even after a pretty dire day such as this one. From Miller, Alan, Venkat and the team, thanks and goodnight! <B>9.58pm</B> Time for the presentations. The Player of the Match is <B>Adil Rashid</b>. "It was assessing the conditions, and adjusting, being clever, varying the pace, finding the right pace to take off. It's crucial as a spin department to assess conditions, the breeze etc. The prep is what I rely on, take some time off to work in the nets, haven't played for a couple of months so falling into place. The aim is to go out there hopefully get another trophy. Have to have the right mindset and it'll take care of itself." <B>Babar Azam</B>: "After six overs we were doing very well, but then I got out, the middle-order needs to step up. England's bowling is very good, so have to take any chance. Need to sort out those things for the World Cup. A few injuries but a lot of positives, our play is good in patches, but to win you need 100%." The Player of the Series is England's captain <B>Jos Buttler</B>. "The performances... we've worked hard in training, good feeling around the squad, Edgbaston the bowling group was fantastic, and today they pegged it back to an under-par score. That quest to keep improving and get better, that's given me extra energy and motivation. Would have been great to have two more games but got some great experience and a lot of guys have been in the IPL, so not short of cricket. Selection is difficult but a nice place to be. Wood and Archer operating together today was really exciting." <B>9.46pm</B> So, that's the end of that. A hefty 27 balls left in reserve, after a ballistic opening gambit from Phil Salt and Jos Buttler. It was a more measured second half of the chase, but by then there was no need to rush. The time in the middle will have been valuable enough, as the defending champions prepare to fly out to Barbados tomorrow morning. As for Pakistan, not a lot to write home about, although Babar and Rizwan's return to the top was a qualified success. Haris Rauf bowled some rockets and deserved better support. Not least, dare one say it, behind the stumps... hadi: "Haris aside, what a sorry bowling performance and as usual middle over woes in batting. Won't be surprised if the minnows beat us in the group stages." RajeshBanda: "If Eng wins (which is obvious), then the man of the match should go to Azam Khan."

<B>4.45pm</B> <B>It's a ten-over contest!</B> Just one lost. Perhaps handily for England, Wiese is now bowled out. Trumpelmann and Brassell could be the men for the final 12 balls. <B>4.41pm</B> The rain has stopped... that is promising from England's point of view. And, frankly, Namibia's too. It's a World Cup! They will be keen to have their day out too. Banshee : "The weather may yet have the last say! Schadenfreude, anyone!" Now now... this is a schadenfreude-free zone. Brian: "The shortened game actually helps ENG's NRR calculation. If ENG had won a 20 over game by 1 run, their NRR would have dropped to a level where it was just possible for SCO to lose a 10 over game to AUS but end up with a better NRR than ENG. But with this as an 11-over game, being shortened as I type, If ENG win even by just 1 run, their NRR doesn't drop so much as after a 20-over game. So if this game ends in an ENG win, then SCO must take a point, or two, from AUS to progress. " <B>4.39pm</B> If this is indeed the end of England's innings, here are the targets that Namibia could be chasing.

There is still blue sky around. And there is still a smidgeon of wriggle room. But it's not impossible that England's innings is over. And maybe even their campaign...

in at the toes, Brook can't get any elevation into his launch to the on-side, but the lack of timing allows them to get back for the second
Ali Nawaz Khan : "Even if England declare here and win a super over, and Scotland lose a superover, England will still progress. So yeah, run rates out the window. " I don't have time to check any sums, but this sounds authoritative so there you go
