<strong>there it is, a whopping 134-run victory for the West Indies! And this is also the joint-lowest team total in the men's T20 World Cup!</strong> Length ball in and around off stump. Nips back in a shade with the angle and beats Nsubuga for pace, who anyway had a half-hearted poke at it. Top of off stump is rattled, and that sums up what has been a terrific bowling performance!
<strong>11:40pm</strong> That's all we have for you from this game. The <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/trophy/team-largest-margins/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-89">second-largest victory (in terms of runs) at the men's T20 World Cup</a> and this has set West Indies up nicely for the matches ahead. There is still plenty of cricket to be played before their next fixture, and there is the small matter of India clashing swords with Pakistan on Sunday, which happens to be the next game at this year's T20 World Cup. Do join us for that potentially riveting contest. Until next time, this is goodbye from me (Shashwat), Chandan and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo. Take care, folks! <b>Rovman Powell, West Indies captain:</b> We talk about improving 10-15% every match. Last game, we were flat so we just wanted to improve as a team. When you are playing at home, the pressure can sometimes get to you. So, a little bit of rust (in the first match). We started off at 60%, now up to 70-80% and from here, it gets tougher. He (Akeal Hosein) has been fantastic, that is why he is the No.3 ranked bowler in the world. He has done it against Full-Member nations as well, and we expect him to do it against teams that are just coming into international cricket. (On the challenges ahead) It is just for us to continue to play good cricket. We have played good cricket for the last 12 months or so. It gets tougher from here but we understand conditions and cricket is not easy in the Caribbean. Since West Indies have come to Guyana, the support has been fantastic <b>Brian Masaba, Uganda captain:</b> Tough day for us. It is a very steep learning curve. Just shows the difference in class. We were outplayed (in all departments) but we must take the learnings from it: as a batting unit, what we can do better to keep us in the game. There were some positives in that bowling performance. To keep them under 200 stood out. The way we bowled at the death, that was very impressive from the two young men (Kyewuta and Miyagi). Hopefully we can build on that. (Experience so far at the T20 WC) It is a huge challenge, but something we are enjoying. We understand that to get better, we need to play oppositions like these and over time, we can hopefully reduce the gap. Good lessons to carry back home. They (the fans) love this team, they have stuck with this team through thick and thin. They are a passionate bunch and we are very proud of them. We definitely enjoy having them around. <b>Akeal Hosein, Player of the Match:</b> I think I needed this. In the nets and in the previous series, I felt the ball was coming out good but I was just not getting the rewards. (On which one was his favourite wicket) I think the regular off-spinner (to dismiss Nakrani), that was my favourite. (On his approach) I think it is a lot of hard work. When you get success, guys are going to study you and have a plan. You always have to stay a step ahead. For me, it is just about trying to react to what the surface is doing and planning it out. Even if the ball is going both ways, you cannot do much if you don't plan. So, it is about planning the over well. I am happy to bowl wherever the team needs me. <strong>11:10pm</strong> A proper hammering. That is what it was. At the half-way stage, it seemed that WI had enough but the way they bowled and how Uganda responded with the bat, just illustrated the gulf in quality and experience. Hosein was Uganda's tormentor and their batters just could not come to grips with his arm-ball throughout his four-over spell. Almost all of his wickets came off that particular delivery and that broke the back of the Ugandan innings. Joseph picked up two as well, with Motie, Russell and Shepherd also chipping in. Coming back to Uganda, their lack of pedigree was shown up. Mukasa was dismissed for another duck and that set the tone for what was to follow. Only Miyagi managed to get into double digits as they crumbled under the pressure the West Indies applied. That said, Uganda will want to use this as a learning curve, rather than getting too bogged down by it. The West Indies are two-time champions for a reason and even though this was another tough initiation into the highest T20I tier, it will certainly help Uganda in the longer run.
