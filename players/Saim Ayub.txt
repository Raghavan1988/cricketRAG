<strong>caught behind! Hazlewood at his best</strong>. Good length, wobbling on off, it hits the seam and nips away as Ayub defends on the front foot, it catches the edge and Carey takes it low to his left. Ayub didn't do a lot wrong. Potentionally could have got a fraction further forward but that was a beauty. It seamed quite a way off the same length as the previous ball. Too good

It's a packed house at Hagley Oval and New Zealand cricket have reminded fans to keep their eye on the ball during the game to avoid any injury. One of the sixes in last game from Babar Azam hit a spectator but thankfully there was no major injury. Temperature around 30C and looks like perfect conditions for cricket. New Zealand team are in a huddle and openers are also ready Grant Elliott said it looks an <strong>exceptional batting deck</strong> with a lot of grass cover, it's dry grass though. The soil is hard so it will offer pace and bounce Hassan Shah: "I dont know what Pakistani think tank is doing. They should have given Azam Khan all 5 matches and then think to drop him for ever. Why could not they drop Haris Rauf and play with Jamal. This is beyond my understanding. They could have even drop or rest Rizwan to test their bench strength. Not sure what they are up to. Usama Malik: "It was a good decision to opt out Azam Khan. He has shown to be rather average at the international level. It's perplexing that some still believe he deserves more chances. After nine matches, spanning three series, he has yet to deliver a noteworthy performance." salman: "Why Mr Mohammad Nawaz always enter into team despite multiple bad performances recent series who is supporting or selecting him although he is useless .." <strong>Haris Rauf: </strong>Last year, we won the triangular series and we will try to put up a similar show here again. We will try to win these two games. In T20, every day is different, I hope today will be better for me. Finn Allen played brilliantly against us but we will try to do better this time <strong>Mitchell Santner, New Zealand Captain:</strong> We've shown some good stuff throughout the series on different wickets. We talk about trying to adapt to each surface. It's been nice having some big scores to defend so now we are going to try to restrict them. Thilan: "Should have given Aamer Jamal one more chance. He can be a great all-round prospect for Pakistan." Sherry: "Pakistan should have played Jamal in place of Rauf.Haris Rauf bowled pretty bad in the second match too but because he got tail enders wickets so he got to play in 3rd T20I as well and we saw what happened next and still he is here playing the 4th T20I.He needs to work a lot on his variations and then return." haadi: "Another concern opening up for Pakistan is, Will they have to re-consider their fast bowling unit for the world cup? As recent performances haven't been up to the usual Pakistan bowling standards." Tanveer : "Dropping Azam Khan is beyond me. Everyone knows that bowling was the reason of down fall of Pakistan in the last game. Why not Iftikhar and Haris Rauf. Why only Azam Khan. Was he the only reason of loss. Please publish my frustration." Sarfaraz: "Absolutely illogical selection by Pakistan,no place for Haseebullah. Iftikhar struggles against spinners, Abbas Afridi dropped despite 2 good matches.Pakistan needs quality all rounders" Abbas hasn't been dropped, he is ruled out of the game owing to a low-grade abdominal wall muscle strain <strong>New Zealand XI: </strong>Finn Allen, Tim Seifert (wk), Will Young, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Philipps, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner (c), Adam Milne, Matthew Henry, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson Will Young comes in for Devon Conway. Ish Sodhi has been rested for this game and Adam Milne has been called back and will play his <strong>50th T20I</strong> in a career that has been marred by injuries but his comebacks have always been impressive, the pace and potency are still the same <strong>New Zealand have won the toss and opted to bowl first</strong> <strong>Shaheen Afridi, Pakistan Captain:</strong> We are preparing for World Cup and need the right combination. We would have batted if we won the toss. Result not in our favour but boys have given their best. There are plenty of areas to improve, after this series, we will see how we can improve. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/hamish-rutherford-announces-retirement-from-all-forms-of-cricket-1417139">Hamish Rutherford announces retirement from all forms of cricket</a>. His last game is on Jan 23 in the Super Smash <strong>6.40pm:</strong> Toss and New Zealand line-up coming shortly. Stay tuned. Asim Zafar: "When we look at the overall performances, both teams have played equally well or badly with Finn Allen being the difference. Conceding 190 plus runs in each T20I is obviously not acceptable and Pakistani middle-order needs to perform better. Even the opening partnership has to put pressure. However, it's not too bad for Pakistan barring Finn Allen factor. " Saj: "What is painfully obvious is that Pakistan lacks quality all rounders which are key in the limited overs game - both T20 " Ghazanfar: "Leta see what shaheen adoes if he wins toss. So far his captaincy has not been impressive at all" Sahibzada Farhan had a superb run in last year's National T20 held in November-December and finished the tournament as the leading run-getter with 492 runs. He struck four half-centuries and scored a hundred against Larkana at the National Stadium. Given his rich vein of form, he could be a handful for Pakistan as they look to shape their squad for the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166">T20 World Cup</a> later this year Jadoon: "Pakistan going with 5 openers. All of them play as opener in domestics and have been selected on that basis. But playing out of position here." Nagraj Todur : "Pakistan should have given one more chance to Azam Khan!! He is capable of scoring good runs" Azam Khan has been left out for this game which means Mohammad Rizwan will be back with wicketkeeping duties <strong>Pakistan's XI for the fourth T20I:</strong> M Rizwan (wk), Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Sahibzada Farhan, Iftikhar Ahmed, M. Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi (c), M. Wasim, Haris Rauf, Zaman Khan Also, New Zealand's bowling coach Andre Adams has also tested positive for COVID and will also remain at the team's hotel. Canterbury Men's Development Coach Brendon Donkers will join the team for today's match to help out in Adams' place. <strong>Devon Conway</strong> won't be part of the fourth T20I after returning a positive test for COVID. He's in isolation at the team's hotel after testing positive yesterday. Canterbury Kings batter Chad Bowes has joined the squad as his replacement. <strong>6.20pm:</strong> After Grant Bradburn ended his tenure with the PCB, Mickey Arthur and Andrew Puttick have also resigned from their respective posts at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. All three were given a new portfolio after the 2023 ODI World Cup. More here:<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/mickey-arthur-and-andrew-puttick-resign-from-their-roles-with-pcb-1417208"> Arthur and Puttick resign from their roles with PCB</a> <strong>6.10pm: </strong> Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of Pakistan's tour of New Zealand. Pakistan is desperate to break their losing streak, and their new captain Shaheen Afridi has had a tough start to his captaincy stint. Pakistan conceded far too many runs in the last game as Finn Allen annihilated bowlers and pummeled 16 sixes in his 137-run rampage. In reply, Babar Azam thumped his third half-century in a row, but once again, there were no significant contributions from other batters. New Zealand have bagged the series 3-0 and don't seem to be dropping their guard as they have played high-intensity clinical cricket and put Pakistan under enormous pressure. I am Rvel Zahid and I'll bring you all the action

It's a packed house at Hagley Oval and New Zealand cricket have reminded fans to keep their eye on the ball during the game to avoid any injury. One of the sixes in last game from Babar Azam hit a spectator but thankfully there was no major injury. Temperature around 30C and looks like perfect conditions for cricket. New Zealand team are in a huddle and openers are also ready Grant Elliott said it looks an <strong>exceptional batting deck</strong> with a lot of grass cover, it's dry grass though. The soil is hard so it will offer pace and bounce Hassan Shah: "I dont know what Pakistani think tank is doing. They should have given Azam Khan all 5 matches and then think to drop him for ever. Why could not they drop Haris Rauf and play with Jamal. This is beyond my understanding. They could have even drop or rest Rizwan to test their bench strength. Not sure what they are up to. Usama Malik: "It was a good decision to opt out Azam Khan. He has shown to be rather average at the international level. It's perplexing that some still believe he deserves more chances. After nine matches, spanning three series, he has yet to deliver a noteworthy performance." salman: "Why Mr Mohammad Nawaz always enter into team despite multiple bad performances recent series who is supporting or selecting him although he is useless .." <strong>Haris Rauf: </strong>Last year, we won the triangular series and we will try to put up a similar show here again. We will try to win these two games. In T20, every day is different, I hope today will be better for me. Finn Allen played brilliantly against us but we will try to do better this time <strong>Mitchell Santner, New Zealand Captain:</strong> We've shown some good stuff throughout the series on different wickets. We talk about trying to adapt to each surface. It's been nice having some big scores to defend so now we are going to try to restrict them. Thilan: "Should have given Aamer Jamal one more chance. He can be a great all-round prospect for Pakistan." Sherry: "Pakistan should have played Jamal in place of Rauf.Haris Rauf bowled pretty bad in the second match too but because he got tail enders wickets so he got to play in 3rd T20I as well and we saw what happened next and still he is here playing the 4th T20I.He needs to work a lot on his variations and then return." haadi: "Another concern opening up for Pakistan is, Will they have to re-consider their fast bowling unit for the world cup? As recent performances haven't been up to the usual Pakistan bowling standards." Tanveer : "Dropping Azam Khan is beyond me. Everyone knows that bowling was the reason of down fall of Pakistan in the last game. Why not Iftikhar and Haris Rauf. Why only Azam Khan. Was he the only reason of loss. Please publish my frustration." Sarfaraz: "Absolutely illogical selection by Pakistan,no place for Haseebullah. Iftikhar struggles against spinners, Abbas Afridi dropped despite 2 good matches.Pakistan needs quality all rounders" Abbas hasn't been dropped, he is ruled out of the game owing to a low-grade abdominal wall muscle strain <strong>New Zealand XI: </strong>Finn Allen, Tim Seifert (wk), Will Young, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Philipps, Mark Chapman, Mitchell Santner (c), Adam Milne, Matthew Henry, Tim Southee, Lockie Ferguson Will Young comes in for Devon Conway. Ish Sodhi has been rested for this game and Adam Milne has been called back and will play his <strong>50th T20I</strong> in a career that has been marred by injuries but his comebacks have always been impressive, the pace and potency are still the same <strong>New Zealand have won the toss and opted to bowl first</strong> <strong>Shaheen Afridi, Pakistan Captain:</strong> We are preparing for World Cup and need the right combination. We would have batted if we won the toss. Result not in our favour but boys have given their best. There are plenty of areas to improve, after this series, we will see how we can improve. <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/hamish-rutherford-announces-retirement-from-all-forms-of-cricket-1417139">Hamish Rutherford announces retirement from all forms of cricket</a>. His last game is on Jan 23 in the Super Smash <strong>6.40pm:</strong> Toss and New Zealand line-up coming shortly. Stay tuned. Asim Zafar: "When we look at the overall performances, both teams have played equally well or badly with Finn Allen being the difference. Conceding 190 plus runs in each T20I is obviously not acceptable and Pakistani middle-order needs to perform better. Even the opening partnership has to put pressure. However, it's not too bad for Pakistan barring Finn Allen factor. " Saj: "What is painfully obvious is that Pakistan lacks quality all rounders which are key in the limited overs game - both T20 " Ghazanfar: "Leta see what shaheen adoes if he wins toss. So far his captaincy has not been impressive at all" Sahibzada Farhan had a superb run in last year's National T20 held in November-December and finished the tournament as the leading run-getter with 492 runs. He struck four half-centuries and scored a hundred against Larkana at the National Stadium. Given his rich vein of form, he could be a handful for Pakistan as they look to shape their squad for the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2024-1411166">T20 World Cup</a> later this year Jadoon: "Pakistan going with 5 openers. All of them play as opener in domestics and have been selected on that basis. But playing out of position here." Nagraj Todur : "Pakistan should have given one more chance to Azam Khan!! He is capable of scoring good runs" Azam Khan has been left out for this game which means Mohammad Rizwan will be back with wicketkeeping duties <strong>Pakistan's XI for the fourth T20I:</strong> M Rizwan (wk), Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Sahibzada Farhan, Iftikhar Ahmed, M. Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi (c), M. Wasim, Haris Rauf, Zaman Khan Also, New Zealand's bowling coach Andre Adams has also tested positive for COVID and will also remain at the team's hotel. Canterbury Men's Development Coach Brendon Donkers will join the team for today's match to help out in Adams' place. <strong>Devon Conway</strong> won't be part of the fourth T20I after returning a positive test for COVID. He's in isolation at the team's hotel after testing positive yesterday. Canterbury Kings batter Chad Bowes has joined the squad as his replacement. <strong>6.20pm:</strong> After Grant Bradburn ended his tenure with the PCB, Mickey Arthur and Andrew Puttick have also resigned from their respective posts at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. All three were given a new portfolio after the 2023 ODI World Cup. More here:<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/mickey-arthur-and-andrew-puttick-resign-from-their-roles-with-pcb-1417208"> Arthur and Puttick resign from their roles with PCB</a> <strong>6.10pm: </strong> Hello and welcome to ESPNcricinfo's coverage of Pakistan's tour of New Zealand. Pakistan is desperate to break their losing streak, and their new captain Shaheen Afridi has had a tough start to his captaincy stint. Pakistan conceded far too many runs in the last game as Finn Allen annihilated bowlers and pummeled 16 sixes in his 137-run rampage. In reply, Babar Azam thumped his third half-century in a row, but once again, there were no significant contributions from other batters. New Zealand have bagged the series 3-0 and don't seem to be dropping their guard as they have played high-intensity clinical cricket and put Pakistan under enormous pressure. I am Rvel Zahid and I'll bring you all the action

New Zealand off to a brilliant start as Ayub tried to cut loose but it was a tentative prod at a wide delivery, could have gone for full-blooded cut, he holds a lot of promise but another early demise for the young talented batter from Karachi

Ireland would have taken note and will be determined to spring some surprises in their home territory. One should never write them off. Anything could happen, so stay tuned for what could be a fascinating contest. With the World Cup less than a month away, Pakistan are yet to announce their provisional squad as they might want to deliberate over a few names. Perhaps, providing clarity to players sooner may have been better, allowing them to be certain of their spots and prepare accordingly. Pakistan is spoiled for choice in the bowling department following the comebacks of Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim. However, the concern lies in their middle order, where Pakistan often slows down, and there are too many batters who prefer batting at the top. To address this issue, Usman Ali has been added to the lineup following his stupendous performances in the PSL 9. He was rather off-color in his debut international series against New Zealand, but he is expected to hit his stride and show his flair as he gets more opportunities to play at the highest level. Irfan Khan Niazi is another promising addition to the lineup--a livewire in the field and a no-nonsense hitter down the order who goes about his business unfazed. These newcomers could help address the middle-order problem Ireland cricketers are at an impasse with their board and are still negotiating their contracts. They could potentially play the upcoming seven T20Is against Pakistan, Netherlands, and Scotland on expired central contracts. More information on the situation can be found in this story: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ireland-could-play-mens-t20-world-cup-on-expired-contracts-1433069">Ireland could play men's T20 World Cup on expired contracts</a> Ireland are coming off a 2-1 defeat against Afghanistan and will be looking to make amends to build winning momentum ahead of the marquee event. Paul Stirling, Harry Tector, and Andrew Balbirnie will need to do the bulk of the scoring. It is a rare occasion for both teams as there hasn't been any bilateral limited-overs series before. Ireland will be facing Pakistan in a T20I for the first time since 2009. Both teams are placed in the same group for the T20 World Cup so this series presents a great opportunity to get familiar with each other's strengths and weaknesses. The teams will lock horns in Florida on 16 June.  India, USA, and Canada are also in the same group.

As we wait for the toss, why don't you read Danyal Rasool's in-depth series preview that covers all the important talking points? <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/spotlight-on-clontarf-as-pakistan-and-ireland-finally-meet-with-priorities-elsewhere-1433066">Spotlight on Clontarf as Pakistan and Ireland finally meet, but with priorities elsewhere</a> "We're not playing any personal games. We'll do whatever's best for the team. It's not to do with individual players' personal preferences. Whatever's the best batting or bowling line-up for the team is the one we'll go with. We're in touch with Gary, and he has a lot of experience with coaching. From what I've said to him he understands what our line-up is and how we're playing. The time for rotation is now a bit late because the World Cup is upon us. The matches we've got left, we'll try to give a run out to the players and combination we want to have for the World Cup." Here's more from <strong>Babar Azam</strong> in his pre-series presser <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/babar-azam-haris-rauf-positive-about-his-involvement-in-2024-t20-world-cup-1432583">Babar: 'Haris Rauf is positive about his involvement in 2024 T20 World Cup'</a> Josh Little won't be available for the series due to ongoing IPL until Gujarat Titans' final game, with Cricket Ireland allowing him to skip their T20I series against Pakistan and tri-series in the Netherlands <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/josh-little-ireland-t20-world-cup-squad-ipl-1432776">Josh Little to join Ireland T20 World Cup squad after IPL</a> <strong>2pm: </strong> Good afternoon and welcome to our coverage of the first T20I of the three-match series between Ireland and Pakistan at Dublin Pakistan had a subpar series against a severely depleted New Zealand side last month at their home, <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/pakistan-vs-new-zealand-2024-1424827">drawing the series 2-2</a>. Ireland would have taken note and will be determined to spring some surprises in their home territory. One should never write them off. Anything could happen, so stay tuned for what could be a fascinating contest. With the World Cup less than a month away, Pakistan are yet to announce their provisional squad as they might want to deliberate over a few names. Perhaps, providing clarity to players sooner may have been better, allowing them to be certain of their spots and prepare accordingly. Pakistan is spoiled for choice in the bowling department following the comebacks of Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim. However, the concern lies in their middle order, where Pakistan often slows down, and there are too many batters who prefer batting at the top. To address this issue, Usman Ali has been added to the lineup following his stupendous performances in the PSL 9. He was rather off-color in his debut international series against New Zealand, but he is expected to hit his stride and show his flair as he gets more opportunities to play at the highest level. Irfan Khan Niazi is another promising addition to the lineup--a livewire in the field and a no-nonsense hitter down the order who goes about his business unfazed. These newcomers could help address the middle-order problem Ireland cricketers are at an impasse with their board and are still negotiating their contracts. They could potentially play the upcoming seven T20Is against Pakistan, Netherlands, and Scotland on expired central contracts. More information on the situation can be found in this story: <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ireland-could-play-mens-t20-world-cup-on-expired-contracts-1433069">Ireland could play men's T20 World Cup on expired contracts</a> Ireland are coming off a 2-1 defeat against Afghanistan and will be looking to make amends to build winning momentum ahead of the marquee event. Paul Stirling, Harry Tector, and Andrew Balbirnie will need to do the bulk of the scoring. It is a rare occasion for both teams as there hasn't been any bilateral limited-overs series before. Ireland will be facing Pakistan in a T20I for the first time since 2009. Both teams are placed in the same group for the T20 World Cup so this series presents a great opportunity to get familiar with each other's strengths and weaknesses. The teams will lock horns in Florida on 16 June.  India, USA, and Canada are also in the same group.
