Phillips is OUT! caught

Glenn Phillips c Abbas Afridi b Shaheen Shah Afridi 26 (22b 1x4 1x6 33m) SR: 118.18
That is a fabulous running catch from Abbas Afridi at deep midwicket, covered a lot of ground while running to his left and made sure to catch it under his eyes. That was New Zealand's last hope and he is dismissed for 26. Seems like Pakistan will get the consolation win
<strong>Pakistan's 134/8 is the lowest 20-over total any team successfully defended in men's T20Is in New Zealand. Previous lowest was 156/6 by Australia in 2021</strong> <strong>Also, it's only the second instance of New Zealand getting bowled under 100 in men's T20Is at home. Other instance was 80/10 in 2010, also against Pakistan in Christchurch (AMI Stadium).</strong> Hamza: "Pakistan seem so much better in the field today. Let's hope this is the start of something." Sherry : "Iftikhar won the match single handedly for Pakistan.Gotta appreciate Shaheen for good captaincy and bowling changes.I hope this would be a lesson for Shaheen that Iftikhar can be a very handy bowler and he would have rued his decision of not letting him bowl in the previous matches." Aby Mathew: "Finally a morale boosting win for pak after the barren run in aus and nz." Memon: "I think dropping Haris Rauf was the best decision for this match.

Phillips comes out of his crease and Cummins pitches it up outside off. Goes past the outside edge as Phillips looks to block. And that will be <b>tea</b>
<b>3.45pm</b> All Australia so far today in Wellington. After that first session which saw them add 104 runs to their overnight score, they have sent half the New Zealand side back in the hut and will be delighted with where they are right now. Blundell and Phillips have a steep task ahead of them. Perhaps Kane Williamson's run out after a mid-pitch collision with his batting partner Will Young sums up New Zealand's day best. Join Gnasher in another 15 odd minutes for the start of today's final session.

<strong>oh dear, what have you done, Nicholas Pooran?!</strong> Back of a length on the stumps. Phillips drops it into the on side and sets off for the single. A bit of yes and no between him and both batters are stranded mid-way. Pooran gathers, takes an age to take aim and then fires a throw at the stumps. He could have run up to the stumps and still gotten the batters out but he went for the glory throw, and failed!
