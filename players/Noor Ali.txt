Despite losing Ibrahim Zadran off the second ball, Afghanistan have been quite dominant with the bat. Noor Ali Zadran in particular has been aggressive on Test debut, going at around run a ball. But now the challenge changes as Prabath Jayasuriya comes into the attack. He'll bowl from around the wicket. One slip and a short square leg in place

Flighted full on off, loopy and drifting into Noor Ali. He looks to whip it away but can only inside edge it to the close-in fielder
