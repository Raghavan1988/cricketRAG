that's three in the over for South Africa and they've come storming back. Dug in short, Bumrah can't get behind the line, is caught in two minds and the steep bounce has its say as the ball balloons off the shoulder of the bat to gully.
We've now seen 17 wickets fall today, the most in a day of Test cricket at Newlands.
