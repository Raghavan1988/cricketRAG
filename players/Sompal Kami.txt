Nepal need 16 off 10. We are waiting for the middle stump to be fixed, after Nortje imparted some damage on it!

<strong>stumped by a country mile!</strong> Tossed up deliciously on a length on off. Kami hares down the track, aiming for the moon. Loses all shape and makes no sort of contact. Litton collects cleanly and then effects the stumping, with Kami well out of his crease. Nepal falling like a pack of cards now!
